	abstract = {Anxiety and depression are highly comorbid and share several common etiological processes. Therefore, it may be more efficient to develop interventions that  treat or prevent these problems together rather than as separate entities. The  present meta-analytic review examined whether interventions for children and  adolescents that explicitly targeted either anxiety or depression showed  treatment specificity or also impacted the other outcome (i.e. cross-over  effects). We addressed this question both within the same type of study (i.e.  treatment, prevention) and across study types. Only randomized controlled trials  (RCTs) that assessed both constructs with dimensional measures were included in  this review. For treatment studies, RCTs targeting anxiety (n = 18) showed  significant effects on both anxious and depressive symptoms, although more  strongly on anxiety than depression; similarly, RCTs treating depression (n = 9)  yielded significant effects on both depressive and anxious symptoms, but stronger  effects on depression than anxiety. Thus, there were cross-over effects in  treatments purportedly targeting either anxiety or depression, and also treatment  specificity, such that larger effects were seen for the target problem at which  the treatment was aimed. Anxiety prevention studies (n = 14) significantly  affected anxious, but not depressive symptoms, indicating no cross-over effect of  anxiety prevention trials on depression. For depression prevention studies (n =  15), the effects were not significant for either depressive or anxiety symptoms,  although the effect was significantly larger for depressive than for anxious  symptoms. Post-hoc analyses revealed that the effect on depressive symptoms was  significant in depression preventions trials of targeted but not universal  samples. Implications for transdiagnostic interventions are discussed.},

Method: A search of the literature was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and manual searches, supplemented by contact with leading researchers. The present meta-analysis used 63 studies and investigated 8,225 participants receiving CBT and 6,986 participants in comparison conditions. Results: Mean pre-post effect size estimates indicate that anxiety-focused school-based CBT was moderately effective at improving symptomatology of anxiety (Hedge's g = 0.501) and depression-focused school-based CBT was mildly effective at improving depression symptomatology (Hedge's g = 0.298) for youth receiving active interventions as compared to those in anxiety intervention control conditions (Hedge's g = 0.193) and depression intervention controls  (Hedge's g = 0.091). Moderators and mediators of treatment outcome were explored. Conclusions: School-based CBT interventions for youth anxiety and for youth depression hold considerable promise, though further investigation is still needed to identify features that optimize service delivery and outcome.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schools in the UK increasingly have to respond to anxiety, depression and conduct disorder as key causes of morbidity in children and young people.  OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the comparative effectiveness of  educational setting-based interventions for the prevention of anxiety, depression  and conduct disorder in children and young people. DESIGN: This study comprised a  systematic review, a network meta-analysis and an economic evaluation. DATA  SOURCES: The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE™ (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands),  PsycInfo(®) (American Psychological Association, Washington, DC, USA) and  Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched to 4 April  2018, and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) was searched on 22 May  2019 for economic evaluations. No language or date filters were applied. MAIN  OUTCOMES: The main outcomes were post-intervention self-reported anxiety,  depression or conduct disorder symptoms. REVIEW METHODS:  Randomised/quasi-randomised trials of universal or targeted interventions for the  prevention of anxiety, depression or conduct disorder in children and young  people aged 4–18 years were included. Screening was conducted independently by  two reviewers. Data extraction was conducted by one reviewer and checked by a  second. Intervention- and component-level network meta-analyses were conducted in  OpenBUGS. A review of the economic literature and a cost–consequence analysis  were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 142 studies were included in the review, and  109 contributed to the network meta-analysis. Of the 109 studies, 57 were rated  as having an unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation  concealment. Heterogeneity was moderate. In universal secondary school settings,  mindfulness/relaxation interventions [standardised mean difference (SMD) –0.65,  95\% credible interval (CrI) –1.14 to –0.19] and cognitive–behavioural  interventions (SMD –0.15, 95\% CrI –0.34 to 0.04) may be effective for anxiety.  Cognitive–behavioural interventions incorporating a psychoeducation component may  be effective (SMD –0.30, 95\% CrI –0.59 to –0.01) at preventing anxiety  immediately post intervention. There was evidence that exercise was effective in  preventing anxiety in targeted secondary school settings (SMD –0.47, 95\% CrI  –0.86 to –0.09). There was weak evidence that cognitive–behavioural interventions  may prevent anxiety in universal (SMD –0.07, 95\% CrI –0.23 to 0.05) and targeted  (SMD –0.38, 95\% CrI –0.84 to 0.07) primary school settings. There was weak  evidence that cognitive–behavioural (SMD –0.04, 95\% CrI –0.16 to 0.07) and  cognitive–behavioural + interpersonal therapy (SMD –0.18, 95\% CrI –0.46 to 0.08)  may be effective in preventing depression in universal secondary school settings.  Third-wave (SMD –0.35, 95\% CrI –0.70 to 0.00) and cognitive–behavioural  interventions (SMD –0.11, 95\% CrI –0.28 to 0.05) incorporating a psychoeducation  component may be effective at preventing depression immediately post  intervention. There was no evidence of intervention effectiveness in targeted  secondary, targeted primary or universal primary school settings post  intervention. The results for university settings were unreliable because of  inconsistency in the network meta-analysis. A narrative summary was reported for  five conduct disorder prevention studies, all in primary school settings. None  reported the primary outcome at the primary post-intervention time point. The  economic evidence review reported heterogeneous findings from six studies. Taking  the perspective of a single school budget and based on cognitive–behavioural  therapy intervention costs in universal secondary school settings, the  cost–consequence analysis estimated an intervention cost of £43 per student.  LIMITATIONS: The emphasis on disorder-specific prevention excluded broader mental  health interventions and restricted the number of eligible conduct disorder  prevention studies. Restricting the study to interventions delivered in the  educational setting may have limited the number of eligible university-level  interventions. CONCLUSIONS: There was weak evidence of the effectiveness of  school-based, disorder-specific prevention interventions, although effects were  modest and the evidence not robust. Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based  interventions may be more effective if they include a psychoeducation component.  FUTURE WORK: Future trials for prevention of anxiety and depression should  evaluate cognitive–behavioural interventions with and without a psychoeducation  component, and include mindfulness/relaxation or exercise comparators, with  sufficient follow-up. Cost implications must be adequately measured. STUDY  REGISTRATION: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42016048184.

	abstract = {Depression and anxiety are often first experienced during childhood and adolescence, and interest in the prevention of these disorders is growing. The  focus of this review was to assess the effectiveness of psychological prevention  programs delivered in schools, and to provide an update to our previous review  from five years ago (Werner-Seidler, Perry, Calear, Newby, \& Christensen, 2017).  Three electronic databases were systematically searched for published articles of  randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of school-based  prevention programs until October 2020. There were 130 articles that met  inclusion criteria, representing 118 unique trials and 45,924 participants. Small  between-group effect sizes for depression (g = 0.21) and anxiety (g = 0.18) were  detected immediately post-intervention. Subgroup analyses suggested that targeted  prevention programs (for young people with risk factors or symptoms) were  associated with significantly greater effect sizes relative to universal programs  for depression, which was confirmed by meta-regression. There was also some  evidence that external providers conferred some benefit over school-staff  delivered programs. Overall, study quality was moderate and no association  between risk of bias and effect size was detected. School-delivered psychological  prevention programs have small effects in reducing symptoms of depression and  anxiety. Refinement of these programs, and knowledge about how they can be  sustainably delivered in schools beyond the trial period is now needed for  population-level preventive effects.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate whether resilience-oriented cognitive behavioral interventions (CBIs) which teach cognitive, problem-solving, and  social skills are effective for addressing depressive symptoms in the school  setting and to investigate factors that could moderate the intervention effects.  METHOD: Electronic databases Medline, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central were searched  to identify potentially relevant trials. The difference of change from baseline  in depressive symptoms between intervention and control condition was assessed.  Mean effect sizes (Hedges'g) were calculated using random-effects models.  Study-specific characteristics relevant to participant demographics (age, gender,  and risk status), intervention conditions (program type, intervention duration,  group leader type, and use of homework), and study features (sample size, and  methodological quality) were evaluated as potential moderators of the effect  size. RESULTS: 38 controlled studies were identified, including 24,135  individuals. At post-intervention, the mean effect size was considered  significantly small (Hedges'g = 0.13) and subgroup analyses revealed significant  effect sizes for programs administered to both universal and targeted samples,  programs both with and without homework, and programs led by school personnel.  The mean effect size was largely maintained at 6 months follow-up and subgroup  analyses indicated significant effect sizes for programs administered to targeted  samples, programs based on Penn Resiliency Program, programs with homework, and  programs led by professional interventionists. CONCLUSION: This study reinforces  the efficacy of resilience-oriented CBIs for addressing depressive symptoms in  the school setting. Although more research is needed to confirm and extend the  findings of this study, our findings suggest a range of directions in particular  for further investigation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: International comparisons found that depression prevalence ranged from 18.3\% (China) to 51.5\% (Zambia) among school students in some low- and  middle-income countries (LMICs). The evidence base for treatment of adolescent  depression in LMICs is limited and inadequate. Moreover, most treatment  interventions are developed in high income countries and the effectiveness of  these treatments in LMICs is largely unknown. METHOD: Randomized controlled  trials, including cluster-randomized trials that have been implemented in LMICs  to reduce adolescent depression, were examined in this systematic review and  meta-analysis. Only one-time point (3 months or close to 3 months) of the outcome  measures was chosen to evaluate effectiveness of interventions. RESULTS: Studies  that used cognitive-behavioral therapy reduced depressive symptoms more  effectively than other treatments with standardized mean difference  (SMD) = -1.27, (95\% CI -2.19 to -0.35). Microfinance/economic interventions also  reduced depression in adolescents with SMD = - 0.35, (95\% CI -0.71 to 0.01) and  Interpersonal therapy was used in three studies and depressive symptoms reduced  by SMD = -0.23, (95\% IC -0.60 to 0.13). Moreover, complex psychotherapeutic  interventions that used integrated techniques showed a reduction in depression  with SMD = -0.23, (95\% IC -0.33 to -0.14) as well. CONCLUSIONS: Across  twenty-eight studies, the evidence showed that cognitive behavioral therapy that  delivered by nurses, social workers and counselors at community-based settings  were more effective treatments in decreasing adolescent depression in LMICs.  Future studies should implement these universal treatment approaches to identify  accessible, feasible, affordable and sustainable depression treatments in the  countries with less available resources.},

	abstract = {Depression contributes about 2\% to the global burden of disease. A first onset of depressive disorder or subsyndromal depressive symptoms is common in adolescence,  indicating that early prevention is a priority. However, trials of preventive  interventions for depression in youths show conflicting results. This systematic  review and meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of group-based cognitive  behavioral therapy (GB-CBT) as a preventive intervention targeting subsyndromal  depression in children and adolescents. In addition, the impact of different  covariates (type of comparator and use of booster sessions) was assessed.  Relevant articles were identified from previous systematic reviews, and  supplemented with an electronic search spanning from 01/09/2014 to 28/02/2018.  The retrieved articles were assessed for eligibility and risk of bias. Relevant  data were extracted. Intervention effectiveness was pooled using a random-effects  model and the impact of covariates assessed using meta-regression. 38 eligible  articles (34 trials) were obtained. The analysis showed GB-CBT to significantly  reduce the incidence (relative risk 0.43, 95\% CI 0.21-0.87) and symptoms (Cohen's  d -0.22, 95\% CI -0.32 to -0.11) of depression at post-test compared to all  controls. Comparisons with passive comparators suggested that the effect decayed  over time. However, compared to active controls, a significant intervention  effect was evident only after 12 month or more. Our results suggest that the  preventive effect of GB-CBT wears off, but still lasts longer than the effect of  active comparators. Only a few studies included booster sessions, precluding firm  conclusions. Future studies should clarify to what extent maintenance strategies  can prolong the preventive effect of GB-CBT.},

The school environment provides an ideal context to deliver prevention programs, with  potential to offset the trajectory towards disorder. The aim of this review was  to provide a comprehensive evaluation of randomised-controlled trials of  psychological programs, designed to prevent depression and/or anxiety in children  and adolescents delivered in school settings. Medline, PsycINFO and the Cochrane  Library were systematically searched for articles published until February 2015.  Eighty-one unique studies comprising 31,794 school students met inclusion  criteria. Small effect sizes for both depression (g=0.23) and anxiety (g=0.20)  prevention programs immediately post-intervention were detected. Small effects  were evident after 12-month follow-up for both depression (g=0.11) and anxiety  (g=0.13). Overall, the quality of the included studies was poor, and  heterogeneity was moderate. Subgroup analyses suggested that universal depression  prevention programs had smaller effect sizes at post-test relative to targeted  programs. For anxiety, effect sizes were comparable for universal and targeted  programs. There was some evidence that externally-delivered interventions were  superior to those delivered by school staff for depression, but not anxiety.  Meta-regression confirmed that targeted programs predicted larger effect sizes  for the prevention of depression. These results suggest that the refinement of  school-based prevention programs have the potential to reduce mental health  burden and advance public health outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are highly prevalent, have a detrimental impact on the quality of life of patients and their relatives and are associated with  increased mortality rates, high levels of service use and substantial economic  costs. Current treatments are estimated to only reduce about one-third of the  disease burden of depressive disorders. Prevention may be an alternative strategy  to further reduce the disease burden of depression. METHODS: We conducted a  meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of preventive  interventions in participants with no diagnosed depression at baseline on the  incidence of diagnosed depressive disorders at follow-up. We identified 32  studies that met our inclusion criteria. RESULTS: We found that the relative risk  of developing a depressive disorder was incidence rate ratio = 0.79 (95\%  confidence interval: 0.69-0.91), indicating a 21\% decrease in incidence in  prevention groups in comparison with control groups. Heterogeneity was low (I(2)  = 24\%). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one new case of depressive  disorder was 20. Sensitivity analyses revealed no differences between type of  prevention (e.g. selective, indicated or universal) nor between type of  intervention (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy or  other). However, data on NNT did show differences. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of  depression seems feasible and may, in addition to treatment, be an effective way  to delay or prevent the onset of depressive disorders. Preventing or delaying  these disorders may contribute to the further reduction of the disease burden and  the economic costs associated with depressive disorders.},

	abstract = {Although under-diagnosed, anxiety and depression are among the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents, leading to severe impairment, increased risk of future psychiatric problems, and a high economic burden to society. Universal prevention may be a potent way to address these widespread problems. There are several benefits to universal relative to targeted interventions because there is limited knowledge as to how to screen for anxiety and depression in the general population. Earlier meta-analyses of the prevention of depression and anxiety symptoms among children suffer from methodological inadequacies such as combining universal, selective, and indicated interventions in the same analyses, and comparing cluster-randomized trials with randomized trials without any correction for clustering effects. The present meta-analysis attempted to determine the effectiveness of universal interventions to prevent anxiety and depressive symptoms after correcting for clustering effects. A systematic search of randomized studies in PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar resulted in 30 eligible studies meeting inclusion criteria, namely peer-reviewed, randomized or cluster-randomized trials of universal interventions for anxiety and depressive symptoms in school-aged children. Sixty-three percent of the studies reported outcome data regarding anxiety and 87 \% reported outcome data regarding depression. Seventy percent of the studies used randomization at the cluster level. There were small but significant effects regarding anxiety (.13) and depressive (.11) symptoms as measured at immediate posttest. At follow-up, which ranged from 3 to 48 months, effects were significantly larger than zero regarding depressive (.07) but not anxiety (.11) symptoms. There was no significant moderation effect of the following pre-selected variables: the primary aim of the intervention (anxiety or depression), deliverer of the intervention, gender distribution, children's age, and length of the intervention. Despite small effects, we argue for the possible clinical and practical significance of these programs. Future evaluations should carefully investigate the moderators and mediators of program effects to identify active program components.},

	abstract = {Background  The onset of depression during adolescence can adversely impact future functioning. Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has been suggested to  prevent depression in adolescence by providing an individual with the ability to  interpret and the tools to deal with the impact of negative life events.  Objective  Examine the best available evidence to determine the effectiveness of  CBT to prevent the onset of depression in young people, and assess whether the  incorporation of hopeful elements makes CBT more effective. Search strategy  A  comprehensive three-step search strategy was developed to find both published and  unpublished studies in English from 1987 to March 2007. Papers selected for  retrieval were then assessed for methodological validity by two independent  reviewers. Selection criteria  Papers that used a randomised controlled design  and investigated the efficacy of CBT to prevent the onset of depression in young  people between the age of 10 years and 16 years were included. Papers were  included if the CBT involved between four and 15 sessions, a follow-up period of  between 3 and 24 months and included typical strategies, such as the  identification of negative and irrational beliefs, the establishment of links  between thoughts, feelings and behaviours, and provided tools so participants  could self-monitor these. Data analysis  Data were extracted using the standard  tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute, pooled in a meta-analysis, and then  grouped and analysed according to the amount of hopeful elements the CBT was  judged to contain. Results and conclusion  Limited evidence was found to indicate  that CBT, regardless of its content (i.e. with or without hopeful elements), is  effective at preventing the onset of clinical levels of depression in young  people on a sustained basis. Nonetheless, given the devastating impact that  depression can have on young people's future functioning, further research is  needed to develop effective interventions to equip young people with the  cognitive skills to buffer its onset on a more sustained basis and to enable them  to reach and sustain mental health.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this review was to evaluate whether the Penn Resiliency Program (PRP), a group cognitive-behavioral intervention, is effective in targeting depressive symptoms in youths. We identified 17 controlled evaluations of PRP (N = 2,498) in which depressive symptoms had been measured via an online search of PsycInfo, Medline, ERIC, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses and by requesting data from PRP researchers. We combined effect sizes (ESs; Glass's d), using random effects models at postintervention and two follow-up assessments (6-8 and 12 months postintervention). PRP participants reported fewer depressive symptoms at postintervention and both follow-up assessments compared with youths receiving no intervention, with ESs ranging from 0.11 to 0.21. Subgroup analyses showed that PRP's effects were significant at 1 or more follow-up assessments among studies with both targeted and universal approaches, when group leaders were research team members and community providers, among participants with both low and elevated baseline symptoms, and among boys and girls. Limited data showed no evidence that PRP is superior to active control conditions. Preliminary analyses suggested that PRP's effects on depressive disorders may be smaller than those reported in a larger meta-analysis of depression prevention programs for older adolescents and adults. We found evidence that PRP significantly reduces depressive symptoms through at least 1-year postintervention. Future PRP research should examine whether PRP's effects on depressive symptoms lead to clinically meaningful benefits for its participants, whether the program is cost-effective, whether CB skills mediate program effects, and whether PRP is effective when delivered under real-world conditions.

	abstract = {Objective: To examine the effect of universal, school-based, resilience-focused interventions on mental health problems in children and adolescents. Method: Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of universal, school-based interventions that included strategies to strengthen a minimum of 3 internal resilience protective factors, and included an outcome measure of mental health problems in children and adolescents aged 5 to 18 years. Six databases were searched from 1995 to 2015. Results were pooled in meta-analyses by mental health outcome (anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, hyperactivity, conduct problems, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and general psychological distress), for all trials (5-18 years). Subgroup analyses were conducted by age (child: 5-10 years; adolescent: 11-18 years), length of follow-up (short: post-=12 months; long: {\textgreater}12 months), and gender (narrative). Results: A total of 57 included trials were identified from 5,984 records, with 49 contributing to meta-analyses. For all trials, resilience-focused interventions were effective relative to a control in reducing 4 of 7 outcomes: depressive symptoms, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and general psychological distress. For child trials (meta-analyses for 6 outcomes), interventions were effective for anxiety symptoms and general psychological distress. For adolescent trials (meta-analyses for 5 outcomes), interventions were effective for internalizing problems. For short-term follow-up, interventions were effective for 2 of 7 outcomes: depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms. For long-term follow-up (meta-analyses for 5 outcomes), interventions were effective for internalizing problems. Conclusion: The findings may suggest most promise for using universal resilience-focused interventions at least for short-term reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms for children and adolescents, particularly if a cognitive-behavioral therapy-based approach is used. The limited number of trials providing data amenable for meta-analysis for some outcomes and subgroups, the variability of interventions, study quality, and bias mean that it is not possible to draw more specific conclusions. Identifying what intervention qualities (such as number and type of protective factor) achieve the greatest positive effect per mental health problem outcome remains an important area for future research.},

This meta-analysis examined 56 manuscripts with a total of 82 studies which focused on school-based programs to determine how they affect depression, anxiety, cognitive skills, self-esteem, coping, and internalizing behaviors. For these specific outcomes, effect sizes ranged from .08 to .25. All combined outcomes yielded a significant effect size of .15. Moderator analyses revealed key differences that identified characteristics of the most effective programs. Targeted programs servicing at-risk students yielded an effect size of .31, while universal programs produced a significant but small effect size of .07. However, the program facilitator seemed to impact the effectiveness of all types of programs. Non-school personnel produced a .39 effect size with targeted samples, and .17 with universal samples, while school personnel produced about one half to a third of the effect.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interest in delivering psychological interventions within schools to facilitate early intervention is increasing. However, most reviews have focused  on universal or preventative programmes rather than interventions designed to  decrease existing symptoms of depression or anxiety. This paper aims to provide a  meta-analytic review of randomised controlled trials of indicated psychological  interventions for young people aged 10-19 with elevated symptoms of depression  and/or anxiety. METHODS: Eight electronic databases were systematically searched  from inception to April 2019 for eligible trials. Study quality was assessed  using two scales designed to evaluate psychotherapy intervention trials. Random  effects meta-analyses were conducted separately for trials that recruited  participants based on symptoms of depression and based on symptoms of anxiety.  RESULTS: Data from 45 trials were analysed. Most interventions studied used  cognitive and behavioural strategies. Few studies met methodological quality  criteria, but effect size was not associated with study quality. Indicated  school-based interventions had a small effect on reducing depression symptoms  (SMD = .34, 95\% CI -0.48, -0.21) and a medium effect on reducing anxiety symptoms  (SMD = -.49, 95\% CI -0.79, -0.19) immediately postintervention. Subgroup analyses  indicated that interventions delivered by internal school staff did not have  significant effects on symptoms. Reductions in depression were maintained at  short-term (≤6 months) but not medium ({\textgreater}6 months ≤ 12) or long-term ({\textgreater}12-month)  follow-up. Reductions in anxiety symptoms were not maintained at any follow-up.  CONCLUSIONS: Indicated school-based interventions are effective at reducing  symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescents immediately postintervention  but there is little evidence that these reductions are maintained. Interventions  delivered by school staff are not supported by the current evidence base. Further  high-quality randomised controlled trials incorporating assessment of longer-term  outcomes are needed to justify increased investment in school-based interventions  for adolescent depression and anxiety.},

A total of 42 articles, including a total of 7310 adolescents, ages 11–18, met inclusion for the meta-analyses. Meta-analyses were completed for each of the three mental health outcomes (stress, depression, and anxiety) and meta-regression was used to determine the influence of type of program, program dose, sex, race, and age on program effectiveness. Overall, stress interventions did not reduce stress symptoms, although targeted interventions showed greater reductions in stress than universal programs. Overall, anxiety interventions significantly reduced anxiety symptoms, however higher doses may be necessary for universal programs. Lastly, depression interventions significantly reduced depressive symptoms, but this reduction was moderated by a combination of program type, dose, race, and age group. Although, school-based programs aimed at decreasing anxiety and depression were effective, these effects are not long-lasting. Interventions aimed at reducing stress were not effective, however very few programs targeted or included stress as an outcome variable.

	abstract = {Anxiety and depression are among the most common mental health issues experienced in childhood. Implementing school-based prevention programs during childhood, rather than adolescence, is thought to provide better mental health outcomes. The present meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of universal school-based prevention programs that target both anxiety and depression in children (aged 13 years or below), and examine three moderators (i.e., program type, primary target of program, and number of sessions) on prevention effects. PsycINFO, PubMED, and Google Scholar were systematically searched for relevant articles published up to and including January 2018. Fourteen randomised controlled trials, consisting of 5970 children, met eligibility criteria. Prevention programs led to significantly fewer depressive symptoms at post-program (g = 0.172) and at long-term follow-up periods (g = 0.180), but not at short-term follow-up. Programs were not found to prevent anxiety symptoms across any time point. Considerable heterogeneity was observed for all effects. Program type and length were found to moderate the relationship between prevention program and outcomes. Prevention programs were effective in preventing depressive symptoms at post-program and long-term follow-up, while no significant preventative effect on anxiety symptoms was observed. The FRIENDS Program and programs which contained a greater number of sessions showed beneficial effects on anxiety and depressive symptoms. Universal programs aimed at preventing both anxiety and depression in children are limited. Future research should investigate the long-term evaluation of school-based prevention programs for anxiety and depression in children.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression among adolescents is rising globally and is the leading cause of illness and disability among adolescents. While antidepressants and  psychotherapy are effective, only about 40\% of depressed adolescents receive  treatments due to lack of professionals and barriers such as cost and personal  obstacles including stigma, lack of motivation, and negative perceptions of  treatment. Use of alternative and complementary treatments for depression is  growing. One such treatment is mindfulness meditation. OBJECTIVE: We examined the  effects of mindfulness interventions on depression among adolescents and explored  the moderator effects of participants, methods, and intervention characteristics.  METHODS: We searched 17 databases from their inception to April 2019 to identify  studies written in English. Search terms included depress* AND mindful* OR  meditat* AND adolescen* OR student*; 29 studies met inclusion criteria. Two  researchers independently coded data from all primary studies. Discrepancies were  discussed with a third researcher to reach consensus. Using the random effects  model, we computed the effect sizes (ESs) of mindfulness interventions on  depression using standardized mean differences (Hedge's g) with 95\% confidence  intervals (CI). Funnel plot, Q statistics, and I(2) were used to test the  heterogeneity across studies. We examined moderators to explore sources of  heterogeneity. RESULTS: Across 29 studies (N=3688), 1839 adolescents participated  in mindfulness interventions; 1849 served as controls. Mean ages ranged from 10.2  to 19.5 years. Mindfulness groups showed reduced depression compared to control  groups (g=.14, 95\%CI[.01-.28], p{\textless}.042). Funded studies showed greater improvement  in depression (g=.34, 95\%CI[.09-.58], p{\textless}.008) compared to unfunded (g=.05,  95\%CI[-.12-.22], p{\textless}.554). Interestingly, while only two research teams studied  mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, they showed trends toward improvement  (p=0.09) in depression (g=.76, 95\%CI[.18-1.34], p{\textless}.010, s=2) compared to adapted  mindfulness interventions (g=.13, 95\%CI[-.04-.30], p{\textless}.140, s=16) or  mindfulness-based stress reduction (g=.07, 95\%CI[-.16-.29], p{\textless}.559, s=11).  Mindfulness interventions with individual counseling tended (p=0.09) to improve  depression (g=.46, 95\%CI[.07-.85], p{\textless}.021, s=3) more than without (g=.10,  95\%CI[-.04-.24], p{\textless}.168, s=26). Depression improved more when follow-up measures  occurred further from the intervention (Slope=.002, τ(2)=.74, Q(between)=4.10,  p=.043, s=29). No quality indicators moderated the ES of mindfulness  interventions on depression. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness interventions are mildly  effective interventions to reduce depressive symptoms among adolescents.  Clinicians trained in mindfulness interventions might encourage mindfulness  meditation as adjunctive/alternative treatment for adolescents with mild or  moderate depressive symptoms as well as for at-risk adolescents to prevent  depression. Funding, type of mindfulness interventions, individual counseling,  and time to follow up were moderators of the effects of mindfulness interventions  on depression in adolescents.},

	abstract = {Depression and anxiety (internalizing disorders) are the largest contributors to the non-fatal health burden among young people. This is the first meta-analysis  to examine the joint efficacy of universal, selective, and indicated preventive  interventions upon both depression and anxiety among children and adolescents  (5-18 years) while accounting for their co-morbidity. We conducted a systematic  review of reviews in Medline, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library of Systematic  Reviews, from 1980 to August 2014. Multivariate meta-analysis examined the  efficacy of preventive interventions on depression and anxiety outcomes  separately, and the joint efficacy on both disorders combined. Meta-regressions  examined heterogeneity of effect according to a range of study variables.  Outcomes were relative risks (RR) for disorder, and standardized mean differences  (Cohen's d) for symptoms. One hundred and forty-six randomized controlled trials  (46 072 participants) evaluated universal (children with no identified risk, n =  54) selective (population subgroups of children who have an increased risk of  developing internalizing disorders due to shared risk factors, n = 45) and  indicated prevention (children with minimal but detectable symptoms of an  internalizing disorder, n = 47), mostly using psychological-only strategies (n =  105). Reductions in internalizing disorder onset occurred up to 9 months  post-intervention, whether universal [RR 0.47, 95\% confidence interval (CI)  0.37-0.60], selective (RR 0.61, 95\% CI 0.43-0.85) or indicated (RR 0.48, 95\% CI  0.29-0.78). Reductions in internalizing symptoms occurred up to 12 months  post-intervention for universal prevention; however, reductions only occurred in  the shorter term for selective and indicated prevention. Universal, selective and  indicated prevention interventions are efficacious in reducing internalizing  disorders and symptoms in the short term. They might be considered as repeated  exposures in school settings across childhood and adolescence. (PROSPERO  registration: CRD42014013990.).},

	abstract = {School based mental health interventions provide a promising treatment pathway for a variety of mental health concerns. They can be provided on a wide scale to students with a variety of presenting concerns, and allow access to needed services where barriers may otherwise prevent treatment. A majority of the existing literature on this topic has focused on elementary-aged populations; however, there is a need to identify effective treatments for older students. Adolescents experience risk factors and psychiatric needs distinct from those of younger children. Accordingly, treatments for younger students may not generalize to adolescents, and it is imperative to identify effective interventions to support this population. While previous research has included adolescents as part of a larger sample, to date there have been no meta-analyses examining the broad impacts of school based mental health interventions specifically among an adolescent population. 
The present study conducted a meta-analysis in order to synthesize the results of existing literature on school based mental health interventions for secondary students. The aims of the study were to identify the overall impact of these interventions on adolescent mental health outcomes and to identify specific moderators that impact the effectiveness of interventions. Moderators examined included broad and narrow target outcomes (e.g., internalizing symptoms, externalizing symptoms, and substance use), intervention modality (e.g., cognitive behavioral, mindfulness-based, etc.), intervention provider (e.g., mental health professional, teacher, computer, etc.), intervention level (e.g., universal, targeted, or individual), and select student characteristics (e.g., status as a racial/ethnic minority or English learner).
Results of this study revealed small overall improvements in adolescent mental health. Examining results based on moderators of interest yielded some larger effects. Intervention level predicted student outcomes, with individual and targeted services leading to greater improvements than interventions delivered universally. Interventions delivered by mental health professionals led to greater improvements than interventions delivered by teachers. Additionally, studies with individual-level interventions addressing internalizing symptoms, studies targeting trauma symptoms, and studies including a high proportion of English learners produced medium to large improvements. Future research should examine additional moderators that may influence adolescent response to intervention such as dose, specific intervention protocol, and additional student characteristics.},
