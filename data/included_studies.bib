	abstract = {Given the rise in depression disorders in adolescence, it is important to develop and study depression prevention programs for this age group. The current study examined the efficacy of Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST), a group prevention program for adolescent depression, in comparison to group programs that are typically delivered in school settings. In this indicated prevention trial, 186 adolescents with elevated depression symptoms were randomized to receive IPT-AST delivered by research staff or group counseling (GC) delivered by school counselors. Hierarchical linear modeling examined differences in rates of change in depressive symptoms and overall functioning from baseline to the 6-month follow-up assessment. Cox regression compared rates of depression diagnoses. Adolescents in IPT-AST showed significantly greater improvements in self-reported depressive symptoms and evaluator-rated overall functioning than GC adolescents from baseline to the 6-month follow-up. However, there were no significant differences between the two conditions in onset of depression diagnoses. Although both intervention conditions demonstrated significant improvements in depressive symptoms and overall functioning, results indicate that IPT-AST has modest benefits over groups run by school counselors which were matched on frequency and duration of sessions. In particular, IPT-AST outperformed GC in reduction of depressive symptoms and improvements in overall functioning. These findings point to the clinical utility of this depression prevention program, at least in the short-term. Additional follow-up is needed to determine the long-term effects of IPT-AST, relative to GC, particularly in preventing depression onset.},

The students completed self-report measures of depressive symptoms (CDI) and negative cognitions (DAS, CASQ, and CTI-C) prior to treatment, at the end of treatment, and 6 months after treatment. Initial analyses included only those adolescents whose T-scores fell between 50 and 70 on the CDI and were later expanded to include the total sample. Classrooms were assigned to either the prevention program or to a control group. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that treatment was not significantly related to changes on the CDI or CASQ for the subgroup or for the total sample. Treatment produced a significant change on the DAS for both the subgroup and the total sample, and on the CTI-C for the total sample only. Exploratory analyses revealed a significant relation between concurrent changes in depressive symptoms and negative beliefs. However, hypotheses that changes in negative beliefs predict changes in depressive symptoms and vice versa were not supported. Further research is recommended to evaluate the merit of cognitive-behavioral therapy as a viable prevention program for adolescents at risk for depressive symptoms.},

Therefore, a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of OVK and SPARX was conducted among Dutch female adolescents (n = 208, mean age = 13.35) with elevated depressive symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: OVK only (n = 50), SPARX only (n = 51), OVK and SPARX combined (n = 56) and a monitoring control condition (n = 51). Participants in the first three conditions received OVK lessons and/or the SPARX game. Depressive symptoms were assessed before interventions started, weekly during the interventions, and immediately after the interventions ended, with follow-up assessments at 3, 6 and 12 months. Intention to treat results showed that depressive symptoms decreased in all conditions (F(12, 1853.03) = 14.62, p {\textless} .001), with no difference in depressive symptoms between conditions. Thus, all conditions, including the monitoring control condition, were equally effective in reducing depressive symptoms. Possible explanations for the decrease of depressive symptoms in all conditions are discussed and suggestions for future research are provided. Dutch Trial Register: NTR3737.},

Sixty-seven 7th grade students with elevated depressive symptoms were recruited from public schools and randomized to the 12-week PTA program with a parent-component or to a school-as-usual control group. The PTA prevention program was well received by students and parents, yielding high rates of participation and satisfaction among those randomized to receive the intervention. However, analyses of the efficacy of the program in changing depressive symptoms were not significant. In terms of our proximal program targets, most differences were not statistically significant, though effect sizes suggested advantage of PTA over control group in coping, cognitive style, and parent-child communication.

Subjects were selected from approximately 500 7th and 8th grade students at a rural middle school using Gate 1 of the Walker-Severson Systematic Screening for Behavior Disorders (SSBD) procedure and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). After screening, subjects were randomly assigned to either a cognitive-behavioral group condition or wait-list control group. Upon conclusion of the cognitive-behavioral interventions, subjects in the experimental and control groups were compared on the following dependent measures: the Nowicki Strickland Locus of Control Scale, the Children's Attributional Style Questionnaire, The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist-Teacher Form, the Achenbach Youth Self-Report Form and the CDI. Pre-and post-test differences in CDI scores also were examined. In comparison to the control group, it was hypothesized that the experimental groups would have a more internal locus of control, a less depressive attributional style, and less depressive behavior and symptomatology as reported on both forms of the Achenbach and the CDI. Significantly lower post-test versus pre-test scores on the CDI also were expected for the experimental group. While no differences between the experimental and control groups were found for locus of control and attributional style, differences were evidenced on specific scales of the CDI. In regard to the Achenbach, findings were not significant with the exception of a significant discrepancy found between teacher and student ratings on the Internalizing scale. The results of the study are discussed in terms of methodological concerns and implications for future practice and research.},

A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted with 976 Year 9–10 students from twelve Australian secondary schools in 2009. Four schools were randomly allocated to the Anxiety Internet-based prevention programme (n=372), five schools to the Depression Internet-based prevention programme (n=380) and three to their usual health classes (n=224). The Thiswayup Schools for Anxiety and Depression prevention courses were presented over the Internet and consist of 6–7 evidence-based, curriculum consistent lessons to improve the ability to manage anxiety and depressive symptoms. Participants were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Data analysis was constrained by both study attrition and data corruption. Thus post-intervention data were only available for 265/976 students. Compared to the control group, students in the depression intervention group showed a significant improvement in anxiety and depressive symptoms at the end of the course, whilst students in the anxiety intervention demonstrated a reduction in symptoms of anxiety. No significant differences were found in psychological distress. The Thiswayup Schools Depression and Anxiety interventions appear to reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents using a curriculum based, blended online and offline cognitive behavioural therapy programme that was implemented by classroom teachers. Given the study limitations, particularly the loss of post-intervention data, these findings can only be considered preliminary and need to be replicated in future research.},

Depression in adolescents is a significant problem that impairs everyday functioning and increases the risk of severe mental health disorders in adulthood. Although this is a major problem, relatively few adolescents with, or at risk of developing, depression are identified and referred for treatment. This suggests the need to investigate alternative approaches whereby preventative interventions are made widely available in schools.

OBJECTIVE
To investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of classroom-based cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in reducing symptoms of depression in high-risk adolescents.

DESIGN
Cluster randomised controlled trial. Year groups ( n = 28) randomly allocated on a 1 : 1 : 1 basis to one of three trial arms once all schools were recruited and balanced for number of classes, number of students, Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) lesson frequency, and scheduling of PSHE.

SETTING
Year groups 8 to 11 (ages 12-16 years) in mixed-sex secondary schools in the UK. Data were collected between 2009 and 2011.

PARTICIPANTS
Young people who attended PSHE at participating schools were eligible ( n = 5503). Of the 5030 who agreed to participate, 1064 (21.2\%) were classified as 'high risk': 392 in the classroom-based CBT arm, 374 in the attention control PSHE arm and 298 in the usual PSHE arm. Primary outcome data on the high-risk group at 12 months were available for classroom-based CBT ( n = 296), attention control PSHE ( n = 308) and usual PSHE ( n = 242).

INTERVENTIONS
The Resourceful Adolescent Programme (RAP) is a focused CBT-based intervention adapted for the UK (RAP-UK) and delivered by two facilitators external to the school. Control groups were usual PSHE (usual school curriculum delivered by teachers) and attention control (usual school PSHE with additional support from two facilitators). Interventions were delivered universally to whole classes.

PRIMARY OUTCOMES
Clinical effectiveness: symptoms of depression [Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ)] in adolescents at high risk of depression 12 months from baseline. Cost-effectiveness: incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) based on SMFQ score and quality-adjusted life-years (from European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions scores) between baseline and 12 months. Process evaluation: reach, attrition and qualitative feedback from service recipients and providers.

RESULTS
SMFQ scores had decreased for high-risk adolescents in all trial arms at 12 months, but there was no difference between arms [classroom-based CBT vs. usual PSHE adjusted difference in means 0.97, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.34 to 2.28; classroom-based CBT vs. attention control PSHE -0.63, 95\% CI -1.99 to 0.73]. Costs of interventions per child were estimated at £41.96 for classroom-based CBT and £34.45 for attention control PSHE. Fieller's method was used to obtain a parametric estimate of the 95\% CI for the ICERs and construct the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, confirming that classroom-based CBT was not cost-effective relative to the controls. Reach of classroom-based CBT was good and attrition was low (median 80\% attending ≥ 60\% of sessions), but feedback indicated some difficulties with acceptability and sustainability.

CONCLUSIONS
Classroom-based CBT, attention control PSHE and usual PSHE produced similar outcomes. Classroom-based CBT may result in increased self-awareness and reporting of depressive symptoms. Classroom-based CBT was not shown to be cost-effective. While schools are a convenient way of reaching a wide range of young people, implementing classroom-based CBT within schools is challenging, particularly with regard to fitting programmes into a busy timetable, the lack of value placed on PSHE, and difficulties engaging with teachers and young people. Wider use of classroom-based depression prevention programmes should not be undertaken without further research. If universal preventative approaches are to be pursued, their clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness with younger children (aged 10-11 years), before the incidence of depression increases, should be investigated. Alternatively, the clinical effectiveness of indicated school-based programmes targeting those already displaying symptoms of depression should be investigated.

Participants ( N = 72) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (A) social skills training with peer interaction, (B) peer interaction alone, or (C) no treatment control. Participants' depressive symptomatology and social skills were assessed at pre-test, posttest, and 1-month follow-up. Depressive symptomatology was measured with self- and teacher-reports on the Reynolds Child Depression Scale (RCDS; Reynolds, 1989). Social skills were assessed with self- and teacher-reports on the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS; Gresham \& Elliot, 1990) and a behavioral role-play measure of social skill effectiveness. Results showed no significant differences between the groups on the standardized measures of depression and social skills. Participants who received social skills training with peer interaction scored significantly higher on observed ratings of starting conversations, using free time, and compromising than those participants who received peer interaction alone. Ratings of clinically significant change were also measured using the reliable change index (RC; Christensen \& Mendoza, 1986). At posttest, 4 participants (all of whom were in the treatment groups) had clinically significant lower self-rated depressive symptomatology. At follow-up assessment, 10 participants (8 of whom were in the treatment groups) had clinically significant lower self-rated depressive symptomatology. In addition, 2 participants (both in the social skills training with peer interaction group) had clinically significant improvements in teacher-rated social skills at 1-month follow-up assessment. Participants and their teachers rated the social skills programs as favorable and worthwhile.},

	abstract = {Background: Depressive disorders are experienced by 3–5\% of the adolescent population at any point of time. They adversely affect adolescent development in a range of areas and greatly increase risk for suicide. The present study investigated the effectiveness of a universal intervention designed to reduce depressive symptoms among students commencing high school. Methods: Twenty-five pairs of secondary schools matched on socio-economic status were randomly assigned to either an intervention or a comparison group (n = 5,634 Year 8 students). The intervention extended over a 3-year period and utilised a comprehensive classroom curriculum programme, enhancements to the school climate, improvements in care pathways, and community forums. A range of measures completed by students, average age at baseline = 13.1 years (SD = .5), and teachers was used to assess changes in depressive symptoms, risk and protective factors relevant to depression, and the quality of the school environment. Results: Changes in the level of depressive symptoms and in the levels of risk and protective factors experienced by students in the two groups did not differ significantly over the 3 years of the study. Furthermore, statistically significant differences in the ratings of school climate across this time period were found only for staff-rated assessments. Conclusions: Despite using an extensive, structured programme, based on best evidence to increase protective factors and reduce risk factors at the individual and school levels, the intervention did not reduce levels of depressive symptoms among participating adolescents. The results draw attention to the difficulties faced when implementing large-scale, school-based, universal preventive interventions. These include the need to develop methods to effectively train teachers across large geographical regions to deliver new interventions with fidelity, the difficulty of engaging young adolescents with prevention programmes, and the long period of time required to implement policy and practice changes at ‘whole-school’ levels.},

Schools were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Aussie Optimism with teacher training, Aussie Optimism with teacher training plus coaching, or a usual care condition that received the regular Western Australian Health Education Curriculum. Students in the Aussie Optimism conditions received 20, 1-h lessons relating to social and interpersonal skills and optimistic thinking skills over the last 2 years of primary school. Parents in the active conditions received a parent information booklet each year, plus a self-directed program in Grade 7. Students and parents completed the Extended Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Students who scored in the clinical range on the Emotional Symptoms Scale were given The Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents IV, to assess suicidal ideation and behavior, and depressive and anxiety disorders. Results indicated that Aussie Optimism with teacher training plus coaching was associated with the best outcomes: a significant increase in student-reported pro-social behavior from pre-test to post-test 1 (maintained at post-test 2) and significantly lower incidence rates from suicidal ideation at post-test 2 and follow-up. No significant intervention effects on anxiety and depressive disorders, and total difficulties were reported. These findings suggest that the AOP with teacher training along with coaching may have the potential to positively impact on suicidality and pro-social behavior in the pre-adolescent years.},

Finding an effective intervention that prevents depression in adolescents is an important public health priority. Participants were 518 high school students (mean age = 15.09; SD = 0.76) from the mid-south of the United States. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: a cognitive-behavioral program (CB; n = 166), nonspecific control (NSp; n = 175), or a no-intervention control condition (NIC; n = 177). Both the CB and NSp conditions consisted of 90-min sessions administered once a week over a 10-week period during regular school hours. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) at baseline; postintervention; and at 4-, 8-, and 12-month follow-ups. The Time × Condition interaction was significant, F(8, 478.57) = 3.32, p = .001, indicating that at the 4-month follow-up, youth in the CB condition had significantly lower CDI scores compared with those in the NSp (p = .047, g = 0.29; CI [0.06, 0.52]) and the NIC conditions (p = .003, g = 0.30; CI [0.07, 0.53]). Future studies need to examine the importance of theory-driven change mechanisms, interpersonal relationships, and structural circumstances in schools as factors impacting the long-term effects of CB prevention programs.

For each of 12 pairs of parallel classes with students (age range 13–20) from five schools (N = 408), one class was randomly assigned to the mindfulness condition and one class to the control condition.

	abstract = {Objective
Depressive disorders in adolescents are a widespread problem with extensive psychosocial consequences. The authors designed a school-based program to prevent the increase in depressive symptoms. The authors expect the program to reduce dysfunctional automatic thoughts and improve social skills and thus prevent the increase in depressive symptoms.
Method
The design includes a training group and a nontreatment control group with pre- and post-measurement and 3- and 6-month follow-up. The authors followed up 324 eighth graders in both groups. School classes were randomly assigned to one of the two groups. The prevention program, LISA-T, is based on cognitive-behavioral therapy concepts and targets of cognitive and social aspects. It comprises 10 meetings of 1.5 hours in a regular school setting.
Results
Increases in depressive symptoms in nondepressed adolescents in the training group were prevented over a 6-month period. Furthermore, adolescents with subsyndromal depression in the training group reported fewer symptoms, whereas depressive symptoms within the control group did not change. However, the groups did not differ with regard to social skills, frequency of negative automatic thoughts, and depressive symptoms before the prevention program.
Conclusions
LISA-T is an effective school-based prevention program for eighth graders with minimal to mild depressive symptoms, but further research is needed.},

	abstract = {Background: Depression often emerges for the first time during adolescence. There is accumulating evidence that universal depression prevention programs may have the capacity to reduce the impact of depression when delivered in the school environment. Objective: This trial investigated the effectiveness of SPARX-R, a gamified online cognitive behavior therapy intervention for the prevention of depression relative to an attention-matched control intervention delivered to students prior to facing a significant stressor—final secondary school exams. It was hypothesized that delivering a prevention intervention in advance of a stressor would reduce depressive symptoms relative to the control group. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in 10 government schools in Sydney, Australia. Participants were 540 final year secondary students (mean 16.7 [SD 0.51] years), and clusters at the school level were randomly allocated to SPARX-R or the control intervention. Interventions were delivered weekly in 7 modules, each taking approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete. The primary outcome was symptoms of depression as measured by the Major Depression Inventory. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed. Results: Compared to controls, participants in the SPARX-R condition (n=242) showed significantly reduced depression symptoms relative to the control (n=298) at post-intervention (Cohen d=0.29) and 6 months post-baseline (d=0.21) but not at 18 months post-baseline (d=0.33). Conclusions: This is the first trial to demonstrate a preventive effect on depressive symptoms prior to a significant and universal stressor in adolescents. It demonstrates that an online intervention delivered in advance of a stressful experience can reduce the impact of such an event on the potential development or exacerbation of depression.

	abstract = {Objective
To conduct a placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness of a universal school-based depression prevention program.
Method
Three hundred ninety-two students age 13 to 15 from two schools were randomized to intervention (RAP-Kiwi) and placebo programs run by teachers. RAP-Kiwi was an 11-session manual-based program derived from cognitive-behavioral therapy. The placebo was similar but with cognitive components removed. Outcomes were self-rated depression scales, the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS), and the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). Follow-up was to 18 months. Analysis was done on an intent-to-treat basis.
Results
Immediately after the intervention, depression scores were reduced significantly more by RAP-Kiwi than by placebo, with a mean difference in change from baseline between groups of 1.5 on BDI-II (CI {\textgreater} 0.38, p = .01) and 2.24 on RADS (CI {\textgreater} 0.22, p = .04). Categorical analysis confirmed significant clinical benefit with an absolute risk reduction of 3\% (95\% CI, 1–11\%, McNemar χ2, p = .03), with the “number needed to treat” for short-term benefit of 33. Group differences in depression scores averaged across time to 18 months were significant on RADS but not on BDI-II. Retention rates were 91\% at 6 months and 72\% at 18 months.
Conclusions
The RAP-Kiwi program is a potentially effective public health measure. Confirmation of effectiveness measuring episodes of depressive illness and broader measures of adjustment is warranted.},

The results showed no main effect of the program on depressive symptoms at one-year follow-up. A moderation effect was found for parental psychopathology; adolescents who had parents with psychopathology and received the OVK program had less depressive symptoms compared to adolescents with parents with psychopathology in the control condition. No moderating effects on depressive symptoms were found for gender, ethnical background, and level of baseline depressive symptoms. An iatrogenic effect of the intervention was found on the secondary outcome of clinical depressive symptoms. Based on the low level of reported depressive symptoms at baseline, it seems that our sample might not meet the characteristics of a high-risk selective group for depressive symptoms. Therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn about the selective potential of the OVK depression prevention program. In its current form, the OVK program should not be implemented on a large scale in the natural setting for non-high-risk adolescents.  Future research should focus on high-risk participants, such as children of parents with psychopathology.},

Mindfulness is being promoted in schools as a prevention program despite a current small evidence base. The aim of this research was to conduct a rigorous evaluation of the .b (“Dot be”) mindfulness curriculum, with or without parental involvement, compared to a control condition.
Method
In a randomized controlled design, students (Mage 13.44, SD 0.33; 45.4\% female) across a broad range of socioeconomic indicators received the nine lesson curriculum delivered by an external facilitator with (N = 191) or without (N = 186) parental involvement, or were allocated to a usual curriculum control group (N = 178). Self-report outcome measures were anxiety, depression, weight/shape concerns, wellbeing and mindfulness.
Results
There were no differences in outcomes between any of the three groups at post-intervention, six or twelve month follow-up. Between-group effect sizes (Cohen's d) across the variables ranged from 0.002 to 0.37. A wide range of moderators were examined but none impacted outcome.
Conclusions
Further research is required to identify the optimal age, content and length of mindfulness programs for adolescents in universal prevention settings.

	abstract = {The transition to adolescence is considered to be a period filled with increased turmoil, often disrupting youth's psychological well-being and resulting in numerous poor outcomes. This study examined the relationship between aspects of mental health and students' academic performance and their beliefs about their academic capabilities among a normative sample of middle school girls. Measures of mental health problems as well as emotional strengths were included. Forty middle school girls from two schools were included in this study. Sixteen of the participants attended a small, predominantly White private school and the remaining 24 students attended a larger and more diverse public school. Pearson correlations were run with the entire sample and at the two schools separately to identify the relationship between the mental health variables and the academic outcomes. Results indicated that mental health functioning was significantly related to students' feelings about their academic abilities, such that students reporting high levels of distress reported more negative attitudes about their own abilities and students reporting high levels of emotional strengths reported more positive academic attitudes. The psychological variables were not, however, correlated with students' true performance on math and reading tests. Results were more pronounced at the more diverse public school than they were at the small private school. These results suggest that more comprehensive screening procedures that look at students' psychological and academic functioning may be important to better understand students' needs and to provide appropriate school-based interventions. This study also examined the effectiveness of a school-based depression prevention program, the Girls in Transition program, which is designed to promote resiliency among middle school girls. Students at the two schools were randomly assigned to receive the intervention immediately (n = 17) or were put into a wait-list control group (n = 20). Data were collected at three separate times: before the intervention began, immediately following the intervention, and at a six-month follow-up period. Paired samples t-tests and one-way ANOVAs were run to examine changes in the study variables over time for each group and group differences at both follow-up periods. Results revealed that students who participated in the program reported increased use of adaptive coping strategies at both follow-up periods. They also reported reductions in symptoms of anxiety and anhedonia and increases in social self-efficacy. Scores among students in the wait-list control group remained stable, though two unanticipated findings were observed. Differences between the two groups at either follow-up period were not detected. Despite evidence of a relationship between mental health factors and academics, participants did not demonstrate gains in any of the academic measures included in this study. Results from this study offer encouraging support for the effectiveness of the Girls in Transition program, though they were severely limited by small sample sizes and high attrition rates.},

In Study 1, a three-session educational intervention was associated with a short-term reduction in extreme-scoring cases of depressive symptoms among boys, but not girls, when compared to a randomly assigned control condition. However, this effect was not sustained over a 12-week follow-up period. In Study 2, a five-session behavioral skills training intervention, failed to demonstrate any differences compared to a random control condition. Neither of the two interventions had any effect on depression knowledge, attitudes toward treatment, or actual treatment seeking. The failure of these interventions to yield long-term effects is discussed in the context of successful prevention interventions for nonneurotic problem behaviors.

	abstract = {Objectives: The research sought to assess the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioural group coaching intervention in impacting positively on depressive symptoms among an all-male, adolescent, school-going population. Design: An experimental design was employed. Twenty-seven participants were recruited from Transition Year students in one secondary school in Cork, Republic of Ireland. They were randomly assigned to either receive the intervention or act as a control group. The intervention programme was delivered in four sessions across four weeks. Method: Depressive symptoms were measured (using CES-DC) prior to random allocation (T1) and then at the end of the final session (T2). Results: A two-way mixed ANOVA found a significant interaction with a large effect size between intervention group and time of assessment (F[1, 21] = 5.63, p = .027), with the intervention group showing a reduction in depressive scores while the control group saw an increase. When change in levels of depressive caseness in both groups was considered, differences were not significant (c2[2] = 3.73, p = .13), but trended in the expected direction with a medium effect size. Conclusion: The results indicate that the implementation of such interventions more widely may prove beneficial, and that further research is merited.

To replicate earlier positive effects of a cognitive-behavioral prevention program of depressive symptoms and to test the hypothesis that the prevention program would be less effective in adolescents with comorbid anxiety and externalizing symptoms, the authors conducted a study involving 301 8th-grade students randomly divided into an intervention group and a nonintervention control group. The randomized design included baseline, postintervention, and 6-month follow-up. The prevention program included 10 sessions held in a regular school setting. The prevention program showed positive effects on depressive symptoms independent of comorbid symptoms. These effects were found mainly with girls independent of their depressive symptoms at baseline, and in part with boys with less severe depressive symptoms at baseline. It is surprising that negative effects of the prevention program on depressive symptoms were found on the depression of boys with more severe depressive symptoms at baseline. The prevention program's low rate of attrition and high recruitment rate support the generalizability of the results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Background
Evidence of the effectiveness, rather than efficacy, of universal school-based programmes for preventing depression among adolescents is limited. This study examined the effectiveness of a universal depression prevention programme, “The Little Prince is Depressed” (LPD), which adopted the cognitive-behavioural model and aimed to reduce depressive symptoms and enhance protective factors of depression among secondary school students in Hong Kong.
Methods
A quasi-experimental design was adopted for this pilot study. Thirteen classes were assigned to the intervention or control conditions according to the deliberation of the programme administrator of the four participating schools. Implementation was carried out in two phases, with a professional-led first phase and teacher-led programme second phase. LPD consisted of a 12-week school-based face-to-face programme with psycho-educational lessons and homework assignments.
Results
Students completed the programme generally showed positive development in help-seeking attitudes and self-esteem. For students who had more depressive symptoms at pre-assessment, the programme was found to be significant in enhancing cognitive-restructuring skills and support-seeking behaviours. The programme was not, however, found to be statistically significant in reducing depressive symptoms of the participants over the study period.
Limitations
A small sample size, a high attrition rate, and a short follow-up time frame.
Conclusions
The LPD programme was successful in building resilience of the students in general and enhancing the cognitive-behavioural skills of students with depressive symptoms. While we did not find sufficient evidence for concluding that the LPD was effective in reducing depressive symptoms, we believe that these results highlight the challenges of implementing evidence-based practices generated from highly controlled environments in real-life settings.},

Data analysis was conducted for 82 female participants. All students completed the CDI, Adolescent Coping Scale and Children's Automatic Thoughts Scale at pre-And post-intervention. The intervention group alsocompleted a 6-month follow-up. At post-intervention, female ACE participants reported significantly reduced depressive symptoms and significantly improved coping skills compared with the control group.

Two hundred and one sixth grade students served as participants in one of four experimental groups: treatment group, attention-placebo group, delayed treatment group, and no treatment control group. All groups, except the control group, participated in the school-based program called "learned optimism." The learned optimism program is an eight-week curriculum-based program designed to assist adolescents in developing a more optimistic self-explanatory style that contributes to resiliency and positive mental health. All participants completed the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) on three occasions: before the learned optimism program began (pretest), immediately after the first eight-week program was terminated (posttest 1) and eight weeks later, after the second eight-week program was terminated (posttest 2/follow-up). The results were unexpected. They showed only a significant difference on CDI total scores between the treatment group and delayed treatment group immediately following both groups’ participation in the learned optimism program. No significant differences on CDI total scores were found at any other time between or within any of the four groups. Some significant differences were found on CDI subscales between the treatment and delayed treatment groups, but not in the expected direction. Results from an informal questionnaire completed by participants showed that most liked the learned optimism program and it made them feel happier. Plausible explanations for the findings were discussed along with limitations of the study and recommendations for future research in this area.},

The content of the intervention was based on a synthesis of the literature describing social support needed and desired by postpartum adolescents.

No significant differences were found in Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression instrument scores among the groups at 6 weeks postpartum. Using path analysis, the authors found that predictors of symptoms of depression at 6 weeks postpartum were (a) receiving more support from friends, family, and others and (b) having low selfesteem.
Conclusion:
These findings differ from earlier studies, and both research and clinical implications are discussed.},

This study examined moderators of the effects of a universal school-based mindfulness program on adolescents’ depressive symptoms. Based on theory and previous research, we identified the following potential moderators: (1) severity of symptoms of depression at baseline, (2) gender, (3) age, and (4) school track. The study uses a pooled dataset from two consecutive randomized controlled trials in adolescents (13–18 years) in secondary schools in Belgium. Results on effectiveness based on the first trial were published in this journal (Raes et al. 2014). A second consecutive trial was conducted to obtain a more equal distribution between school tracks and to enlarge power, yielding a total of 605 students from nine schools. In each school, parallel classes were randomized to the mindfulness condition or usual curriculum control condition. Data were collected 1 week before and 1 week after delivery of the training and at 6-month follow-up. Moderation was tested longitudinally with multilevel models across the three repeated measures and across condition. We found no moderation effects of gender, age, and school track. Six months after the training, we found a marginally significant moderation effect for severity of symptoms of depression at baseline with greater decrease in symptoms for students with high levels of depression. The general absence of differential intervention effects for gender, age, and school track supports the broad scope of the school-based mindfulness group intervention.},

CB group also had a positive effect on depressive symptoms, intermediate outcomes (pleasant activities, negative thoughts), and one secondary outcome (improved interaction with parents) at posttest. These effects were not maintained at follow-up. This trial replicates results from a previous US effectiveness trial. The clinically meaningful effects of brief indicated CB group prevention, at least with regard to the prevention of MDD onset, hold in French-Canadian students when the intervention is implemented by school clinicians.

	abstract = {Depression represents a serious mental health problem that affects the lives of many children. Depression is frequently cited as the most recurrent emotional problem facing younger populations. Left untreated, depression can have several negative ramifications on later adjustment, including suicide, substance use, academic and social difficulties, low self-esteem, and an increased risk for other mental health problems.
The search for effective treatments for depression has extended into several arenas. Schools play an important role in the lives of children and provide an ideal setting for early detection and remediation of depression at every stage. Schools are increasingly being encouraged to offer preventative mental health services to deal with emotional issues that may often go unnoticed until a crisis situation. However, there remain a small number of studies that have investigated the impact of school-based preventative interventions for depression. For this reason, a school-based, primary prevention study was conducted.
The current study utilized an interpersonal and cognitive-behavioral model that was incorporated into the health education curriculum of the school. The sample included four fifth-grade classes in a rural school district. The study was conducted using a quasi-experimental design similar to a Solomon four-group design with two intervention and two control classes. The intervention was a total of eight 50-minute sessions. The subjects were assessed using a variety of self-report, sociometric, and rating-scale instruments.
The results of the study suggest that social skills were statistically significantly impacted by the intervention, and moderate standardized mean difference effect sizes (ES) of.51 and.48 were found. Depressive symptom reduction was less pronounced. Additional findings indicate that the children did in fact learn the principles conveyed throughout the intervention, including methods of alleviating depressive symptomatology and social skills relevant for fifth-grade children. The results are discussed in the context of primary prevention models in other areas of mental health.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of an 18-hr cognitive behavioral group intervention in reducing depressive symptoms (and associated outcomes) in a universal sample of students in mainstream schools in England. The intervention, the UK Resilience Programme (UKRP), was based on the Penn Resiliency Program for Children and Adolescents.
METHOD: Students (N = 2,844; 49\% female; 67\% White) were ages 11-12 at 16 schools. Classes of students were assigned arbitrarily into intervention (UKRP) or control (usual school provision) conditions based on class timetables. Outcome measures were the Children's Depression Inventory (Kovacs, 1992) (depressive symptoms, primary outcome); Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (C. R. Reynolds \& Richmond, 1985) (anxiety); and child-reported Goodman (1997) Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (behavior). Students were surveyed at baseline, postintervention, 1-year follow-up, and 2-year follow-up.
RESULTS: At postintervention, UKRP students reported lower levels of depressive symptoms than control group students, but the effect was small (d = 0.093, 95\% CI [-0.178, -0.007], p = .034) and did not persist to 1-year or 2-year follow-ups. There was no significant impact on symptoms of anxiety or behavior at any point.
CONCLUSIONS: UKRP produced small, short-term impacts on depression symptoms and did not reduce anxiety or behavioral problems. These findings suggest that interventions may produce reduced impacts when rolled out and taught by regular school staff. We discuss the implications of these findings for policy and for future dissemination efforts.},

We also examined whether grade level moderated the effects of the intervention.

A subsample of 503 adolescents provided salivary samples for cortisol and DHEA-S testing. In 8th grade, adolescents who received the incremental theory intervention displayed a greater decrease in depressive symptoms and cognitive schemas and a lower increase in DHEA-S. Moreover, in adolescents who received the intervention, the rate of adolescents with high depression scores decreased by almost 18\% whereas in the control group, the rate increased by 37\%. Surprisingly, the effects of the intervention were in the opposite direction among adolescents in 9th grade. These data indicate that a brief universal intervention could prevent depressive symptoms under some conditions, but developmental characteristics can moderate the effectiveness of this approach.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Schools may provide a convenient intervention setting for young people with mental health problems generally, as well as for those who are unwilling or unable to access traditional clinic-based mental health services. However, few studies focus on older adolescents, or those from ethnic minority groups. This study aims to assess the feasibility of a brief school-based psychological intervention for self-referred adolescents aged 16–19 years.
Methods
A two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in 10 inner-city schools with block randomisation of schools. The intervention comprised a one-day CBT Stress management programme with telephone follow-up (DISCOVER) delivered by 3 psychology (2 clinical and 1 assistant) staff. The control was a waitlist condition. Primary outcomes were depression (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire; MFQ) and anxiety (Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale; RCADS-anxiety subscale). Data were analysed descriptively and quantitatively to assess feasibility.
Results
155 students were enrolled and 142 (91.6\%) followed up after 3 months. Participants were predominantly female (81\%) and the mean age was 17.3 years, with equal numbers enrolled from Year 12 and Year 13. Over half (55\%) of students were from ethnic minority groups. Intraclass correlations were low. Variance estimates were calculated to estimate the sample size for a full RCT. Preliminary outcomes were encouraging, with reductions in depression (d = 0.27 CI-0.49 to −0.04, p = 0.021) and anxiety (d = 0.25, CI-0.46 to −0.04, p = 0.018) at follow-up.
Conclusions
Results support the feasibility of a school-based, self-referral intervention with older adolescents in a definitive future full-scale trial (Trial no. ISRCTN88636606).},

The present pilot study was an endeavor to assess the felt needs of adolescents vis-à-vis the difficulties and stressors experienced by them. For this purpose, 300 students across three schools were screened using standardized measures. Another objective of the study was to develop and test a school-based Coping Skills Program to address adolescents at-risk for depression. Schools were sequentially assigned to intervention or control conditions; students of index (n=13) and control (n=6) groups were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 3 months follow-up. At post-intervention for the index group, all outcomes measures except coping skills—including depressive symptoms, negative cognitions, academic stress, and social problem-solving—showed change in the expected direction, this difference assuming significance at follow-up. The program was rated positively by students using anonymous feedback and there was low to nil perceived stigmatization. Results are discussed in the context of need for such intervention programs in India, and future scope of research involving larger samples.},

	abstract = {Transition age youth with disabilities are at an elevated risk to experience depression and anxiety compared to youth without disabilities. The current study evaluates the implementation feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of the Think, Be, Do curriculum (a mental health curriculum) for transition age students in special education classrooms. The Think, Be, Do curriculum is a teacher delivered, ten-session mental health curriculum, based in cognitive behavioral and ecological theory, that promotes behavior activation and cognitive reframing of negative thoughts. A total of 11 classrooms were recruited and 115 students participated in a randomized controlled trial. Classrooms were randomly assigned to either treatment (n = 7) or control condition (n = 4). Treatment condition classrooms were exposed to the Think, Be, Do curriculum twice a week for five weeks. Control condition classrooms were instructed to continue business as usual. Results from the pre-post feasibility trial indicate that the Think, Be, Do curriculum was feasible to implement with high fidelity, and was acceptable to the teachers who implemented the curriculum and for student participants. In addition, student knowledge increased on common mental health concerns (e.g., depression and anxiety) for participants in the treatment condition. There were no clinically meaningful differences found between conditions on the putative mechanisms (e.g., behavior activation, negative thoughts), internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and academic competence. Implications for research and practice are discussed, including the need for further curriculum adaptation, development of reliable and valid mental health measures, and the need for a more targeted implementation approach.},

	abstract = {There is a need to find sustainable approaches to the prevention of adolescent depression. The Resourceful Adolescent Program (RAP) is a strengths-focused, resilience-building program designed to intervene when young people are aged 12-15 (just before the sharp increase in the incidence of depression). The aim of RAP is to facilitate development of positive coping and interpersonal skills to build resilience to help prevent the development of depressive symptoms in young people. RAP has been primarily designed as a universal school-based program to be run as an integral part of the school curriculum with students in grades 8-10 in groups of about 10-15 students. There is also evidence that RAP can be effectively applied as a selective or indicated prevention and early intervention program. The program integrates elements of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) with interpersonal perspectives on depression, and has the overarching aim of assisting teenagers in self-regulation and managing the daily vicissitudes of self-esteem. It is an 11 -session program that can be implemented by mental health professionals and teachers who have undergone training in the program. One of the essential features of the program is that it is a very positively-focused program that concentrates on 'building strengths' rather than 'repairing deficits'. The efficacy and effectiveness of RAP have been systematically researched over the past ten years through randomized controlled trials. We have good evidence of program efficacy and some encouraging (although mixed) evidence of real world sustainability and effectiveness. In what follows, we describe our rationale for a universal approach to preventing teenage depression. We then describe the theoretical rationale for RAP, the intervention goals and approaches, a summary of the session-by-session content, the research findings in relation to RAP, special adaptations, and directions for the future.

	abstract = {Background: This study evaluates the benefits of a self-directed Internet intervention for depression (MoodGYM) delivered as a part of the high school curriculum. Method: One hundred and fifty-seven girls, aged 15 and 16 years, were allocated to undertake either MoodGYM or their usual curriculum. MoodGYM's impact on depressive symptoms, risk of depression, attributional style, depression literacy and attitudes toward depression was examined using random effect regression. Results: MoodGYM produced a significantly faster rate of decline in depressive symptoms over the trial period than the control condition. The effect size for MoodGYM was not significant immediately after the intervention (Cohen's d=.19, 95\% CI −.18–.56) but was moderate and significant 20 weeks after the intervention (d=.46, 95\% CI .10–.82). Girls with high depression scores before intervention showed the strongest benefits on self-reported depression at follow-up (d=.92, 95\% CI .10–1.38). There were no significant intervention effects on depression status, attributional style, depression literacy, and attitudes. Approximately 70\% of girls in the MoodGYM group completed less than three of its modules and completion of fewer modules was related to high depression score before intervention. Conclusions: The findings suggest that there are benefits from MoodGYM on self-reported depressive symptoms but has low rates of completion highlight problems in ensuring adherence to Internet programs for depression.

	abstract = {This study evaluated the effectiveness of a cognitive behaviour therapy Internet program (MoodGYM) for depressive symptoms, attributional style, self‐esteem and beliefs about depression, and on depression and depression‐vulnerable status in male youth. A total of 78 boys age 15 and 16 years were allocated to either undertake MoodGYM or to standard personal development activities. Outcomes were measured before commencement, post‐program and 16 weeks post‐program. There were no significant between‐group differences in change scores pre‐ to post‐ or pre‐ to follow‐up using the intention to treat sample or for participants with post‐ and/or follow‐up data. For boys completing 3 or more modules there were small relative benefits of MoodGYM for depressive symptoms (Effect Size, ES = 0.34), attributional style (ES = 0.17) and self‐esteem (ES = 0.16) at post‐program, although only the effect for self‐esteem was sustained at follow‐up. Both groups showed improvement in their beliefs about depression at follow‐up, with the control group showing a moderate relative benefit (ES = 0.40). While the numbers are small, there was a reduction in the risk of being depressed in the MoodGYM group of 9\% at post‐treatment compared with a slightly increased risk for the control group. The risk of being classified as vulnerable to depression reduced by 17\% in the MoodGYM group at post‐treatment compared with no change in risk for the control group. These reductions in risk for the MoodGYM group were not sustained at follow‐up. The limitations of the study highlight several important challenges for MoodGYM and other self‐directed Internet cognitive behaviour therapy programs. These include how to ensure enough of the program is received and that people who could potentially benefit access the program and continue to remain engaged with it, and how to enhance the sustainability of any benefits.},

Could this be due in part to increasing beliefs about the fixedness of personal traits at a time of frequent social setbacks? And could teaching adolescents that people can change help prevent the increase in depressive symptoms? A longitudinal intervention experiment involved three independent samples of students entering high school (N = 599). A brief self-administered reading and writing activity taught an incremental theory of personality?the belief that people?s socially relevant characteristics have the potential to change. The intervention reduced the incidence of clinically significant levels of self-reported depressive symptoms 9 months postintervention by nearly 40\% among adolescents assigned to the intervention condition, compared with control participants. Analyses of symptom clusters, measures of self-esteem, and measures of natural language use explored the outcomes that did and did not show treatment effects. Moderation analyses confirmed theoretical expectations. Among adolescents assigned to the control condition, those who endorsed more of an entity theory of personality?believing people cannot change?showed greater increases in depressive symptoms during the year. The effect of this risk factor was eliminated by the intervention.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic program (EMOTION, Coping Kids Managing Anxiety and Depression) targeting symptoms of anxiety and depression in schoolchildren by comparing the intervention condition (EC) to a control condition (CC).
METHOD: A clustered randomized design was used with schools as the unit of randomization. Children (N = 1686) aged 8-12 years in 36 schools completed screening using the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale (MASC-Child) and The Mood and Feelings Questionnaire Short version (SMFQ-Child). Scoring 1 SD above a population-based mean on anxiety and/or depression, 873 children were invited to participate. Intent-to-treat analyses were performed, and mixed-effects models were used.
RESULTS: Analyses revealed significant reductions of anxious and depressive symptoms as reported by the children, in which children in the intervention condition EC had almost twice the reduction in symptoms compared with the control condition CC. For parent report of the child's depressive symptoms, there was a significant decrease of symptoms in the intervention condition EC compared with CC. However, parents did not report a significant decrease in anxious symptoms in the intervention condition EC as compared with CC.
CONCLUSION: A transdiagnostic prevention program, provided in schools, was successful in reducing youth-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression and parent-reported depression. The EMOTION program has the potential to reduce the incidence of anxious and depressive disorders in youth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).},
