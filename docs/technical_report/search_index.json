Analyzing School-Based Interventions for Primary and Secondary Prevention of Depression. It documents the methods and results of our rapid overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses on the effectiveness of depression prevention interventions delivered directly to students in primary and secondary school settings. We searched PubMed, ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses A&amp;I, and Social Science Premium Collection for systematic reviews that included a meta-analysis on school-based depression prevention interventions. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed full texts for eligibility, collected data, and critically appraised systematic reviews. To estimate effectiveness and explore sources of heterogeneity for interventions delivered directly to students during normal school hours, we conducted random effects meta-analyses using data from primary studies. We identified 24 eligible systematic reviews that included 450 primary studies overall; of these, 70 primary studies evaluated 84 active interventions delivered directly to 44,519 students during normal school hours. The majority of these 70 primary studies were cluster-randomized trials (33 studies, 51.4%) and took place in secondary school settings (39 studies, 55.7%). Students receiving depression prevention interventions had a 33% reduced risk of meeting criteria for a depression diagnosis relative to students in control groups (risk ratio = 0.67, 95% CI [0.48 to 0.93], 95% PI [0.27 to 1.66], \\(I^2\\) = 67%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.14). Students receiving depression prevention interventions also had lower depression symptoms relative to students in control groups (standardized mean difference = -0.12, 95% CI [-0.20, -0.04], 95% PI [-0.57, 0.33], \\(I^2\\) = 71%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.05). Interventions may have little to no average effect on anxiety symptoms, though the evidence is very uncertain. We could not conduct meta-analyses for all other outcomes. Based on the findings of previous reviews and our meta-analyses, school-based depression prevention interventions may reduce the risk of depression and severity of depression symptoms. However, we have concerns about risk of bias in this body of evidence, and effects vary considerably due to unidentified factors. The evidence is very uncertain about effects on other outcomes. While the evidence suggests schools are more likely than not to benefit from implementing these interventions in contexts similar to those in the review, users of this evidence should be aware that current research evidence suggests both positive and negative effects are possible. "],["background.html", "1 Background 1.1 Why It Is Important to Do This Review 1.2 Objectives", " 1 Background Depression is one of the most common mental health challenges facing children and adolescents today. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, prevalence rates of clinically elevated depression symptoms among youth in the United States were approximately 12.9% (Lu, 2019). Estimates derived during the COVID-19 pandemic era document markedly elevated rates of depression symptoms relative to those before the pandemic: 16.7% of youth ages 5-17 now experience clinically elevated symptoms of depression (Zablotsky et al., 2022). These elevations in depression and depression symptomology are observed in children and adolescents across the world, with a recent meta-analysis documenting that the global prevalence of clinically elevated depression for youth is 25.2% (Racine et al., 2021). In addition, findings from the National Survey of Childrens Health documented the lifetime prevalence of clinical (diagnosed) depression at 4.4% of U.S. children and adolescents ages 3-17 (Bitsko et al., 2022). However, prevalence of depression may increase throughout childhood and adolescence, as lifetime prevalence estimates for youth ages 12-17 are much higherone estimate is 20.9% of U.S. adolescents having experienced clinical depression (Bitsko et al., 2022). In the face of these alarmingly high rates of child and adolescent depressionespecially following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemicurgent calls have been made to prioritize the well-being and mental health of students in primary and secondary schools (Shim et al., 2022). Left unaddressed, depression exerts a host of negative outcomes for youth during childhood and adolescenceand extending into adulthood. These challenges include academic problems (Clayborne et al., 2019; Finning et al., 2019), alcohol and other drug use (Groenman et al., 2017), and family conflicts and relational challenges (Clayborne et al., 2019). Due to the high and increasing prevalence of depression among primary and secondary school studentsand the negative developmental sequalae that often followdepression is a serious public health issue in need of timely and effective prevention of its onset and consequences. 1.1 Why It Is Important to Do This Review School-based intervention is a promising approach to prevent youth depression (National Research Council, 2009). Schools are one of few settings where nearly all children and adolescents can be reached (Arora et al., 2019). The delivery of prevention services in the school setting importantly eliminates the many barriers that exist when families seek out mental health support, such as time, transportation, stigma around seeking mental health support, staffing shortages, and scheduling challenges (Werner-Seidler et al., 2021). Many systematic reviews and meta-analyses have assessed the effectiveness of school-based interventions to prevent depression (Ahlen et al., 2015; Caldwell et al., 2019a; Dray et al., 2017; Feiss et al., 2019; Rasing et al., 2017; Stockings et al., 2016; Werner-Seidler et al., 2021). An overview (also known as a meta-review or umbrella review) can systematically and coherently identify, collate, and synthesize these systematic reviews into a single document on the best available evidence to inform policy and practice decisions (Aromataris et al., 2020; Gates et al., 2022; Pollock et al., 2022). Several overviews of reviews have been published recently on interventions to prevent depression and depression episodes (Bell√≥n et al., 2015; Hoare et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2020; Salazar de Pablo et al., 2021). While useful contributions to the literature, these reviews take a broader scope than youth and school-based interventions, resulting in limited information specific to these populations and settings. In addition, only one prior review included secondary prevention interventions in their syntheses, and none included evidence on outcomes beyond depression (such as student well-being and educational achievement) that are of crucial interest to educational stakeholders. Moreover, several systematic reviews on depression prevention interventions for youth are missing from these overviews (Johnstone et al., 2018; Phillips &amp; Mychailyszyn, 2022; Tejada-Gallardo et al., 2020; Werner-Seidler et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022). 1.2 Objectives This technical report is a companion to Do School-Based Depression Prevention Programs Support Youth? Analyzing School-Based Interventions for Primary and Secondary Prevention of Depression. It documents the methods and results of our rapid overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses on the effectiveness of depression prevention interventions delivered directly to students in primary and secondary school settings. Our overview aimed to assess the effects of school-based depression prevention interventions on depression diagnoses, subsyndromal depression, depressive symptoms, and non-depression outcomes related to student well-being and educational achievement. Our overview also explored whether these effects vary by methodological, demographic, and intervention characteristics. Our goal of this overview of reviews on school-based prevention interventions is to support the decisions of education stakeholders related to the development of policies, practice guidelines, and professional preparation and continuing development programs focused on youth behavioral health. "],["methods.html", "2 Methods 2.1 Eligibility Criteria 2.2 Information Sources 2.3 Search Strategy 2.4 Selection Process 2.5 Data Collection Process and Items 2.6 Risk of Bias 2.7 Synthesis Methods", " 2 Methods Our methods and reporting are informed by guidance from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015 (PRISMA-P 2015) Statement (Moher et al., 2015), the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews (PRIOR) Statement (Gates et al., 2022), the PRISMA extension for reporting literature searches in systematic reviews (Rethlefsen et al., 2021), JBI guidance on umbrella reviews (Aromataris et al., 2020), and Cochrane guidance on overviews of reviews (Pollock et al., 2022). 2.1 Eligibility Criteria We included systematic reviews with a meta-analysis examining the effects of school-based depression prevention interventions delivered directly to primary and secondary school students. We used the definition of a systematic review provided in the PRISMA-P 2015 reporting guideline: a systematic review attempts to collate all relevant evidence that fits pre-specified eligibility criteria to answer a specific research question. It uses explicit, systematic methods to minimize bias in the identification, selection, synthesis, and summary of studies (Moher et al., 2015). We used this definition to identify reviews that have the potential to provide reliable findings for evidence-informed decision-making. Based on this definition, our operational criteria for a systematic review were: (i) clear objectives, (ii) an explicit and reproducible methodology, (iii) a systematic search strategy for attempting to identify all studies that meet the review eligibility criteria, (iv) critical appraisal of the included studies, and (v) systematic synthesis of the characteristics and findings of the included studies. We excluded systematic reviews that did not report the results for a meta-analysis of school-based depression prevention interventions on at least one depression outcome (depression diagnosis, subsyndromal depression, or depression symptoms). We also excluded reviews on interventions delivered in school settings but only during out-of-school time (e.g., after school, summer break). Due to limitations in resources and review team language proficiency, we excluded reviews published in a language other than English. Although grey literature was eligible, we excluded reviews published only in a summary format (e.g., only as a conference abstract or executive summary). For our meta-analysis of data from primary studies in eligible systematic reviews, we included evaluations of a school-based depression prevention intervention directly delivered to primary and secondary school students during normal school hours. We excluded studies that included pre-school or college students if less than 50% of the sample was primary and secondary school students. We used the National Research Council (2009) definitions for primary (universal) and secondary (selective and indicated) prevention of prevention; we consequently excluded evaluations of interventions characterized by (1) a focus on broad mental health and well-being but not specifically on depression (even if depression was a measured outcome), (2) screening for or identifying students with depression, or (3) treating students with depression (based on either a verified diagnosis or use of an established cutoff score for a validated measure of depression). We also excluded interventions that did not have a component (1) delivered directly to students, (2) delivered during normal school hours, and (3) focused on depression specifically. Although we excluded primary studies without a comparison group, we did not restrict inclusion based on type of comparator intervention or method of assignment to intervention group. 2.2 Information Sources We searched for eligible systematic reviews published using the following electronic databases (with search platforms in parentheses): PubMed (National Library of Medicine), ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses A&amp;I (ProQuest), and Social Science Premium Collection (ProQuest). The Social Science Premium Collection includes the Criminology Collection, Education Collection (which includes Education Resources Information Center, or ERIC), International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Library &amp; Information Science Collection, Linguistics Collection, Politics Collection, Social Science Database, and Sociology Collection. Given the rapid timeframe of our overview, we did not search systematic review registries, web search engines, specific web sites, or journal tables of contents, nor did we conduct a search for primary studies missed by included systematic reviews. 2.3 Search Strategy One author who is an experienced systematic reviewer (EETS) developed the search strategy, and another author experienced in systematic reviews (SG) subsequently reviewed the strategy prior to execution using the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) Guideline (McGowan et al., 2016). This PRESS peer review led to including additional prevention terms in subject headings (primary prevention, selective prevention, indicated prevention), as well as adding indicated and meta to our free text search of titles and abstracts. As a result of the PRESS peer review, we also explored several subject headings and exploding broad subject headings that we ultimately did not include due to concerns of significantly increasing the number of false positives yielded by our search strategy. We used previous overviews identified in our preliminary scans of the literature to inform our search terms (Hoare et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2020; Levinson et al., 2019; Salazar de Pablo et al., 2021). To focus on literature published after the conceptualization of subsyndromal depression (Volz et al., 2022) and following JBI recommendations (Aromataris et al., 2020), we limited our search to publications from 1990 until the date of the search (October 20th, 2022). Our search strategy did not involve the use of any published search filters. 2.4 Selection Process One team member (SDT) searched for duplicates using the Duplicate Items function in Zotero prior to uploading citations into our web-based systematic review data management software (FileMaker Pro). We then used standardized forms in FileMaker Pro for the citation screening. After training in the standardized forms (led by SG) and FileMaker Pro software (led by SDT and EETS), two reviewers (a combination of ED, EETS, MSC, and SG) independently screened the title and abstract of each citation for potentially eligible systematic reviews. Reviewers were not blind to journal titles nor to study authors and their institutions. We retrieved the full text for each citation deemed potentially eligible by at least one reviewer. Two reviewers (a combination of ED, MSC, and SG) then independently assessed each full text for eligibility. We included all systematic reviews deemed eligible by both reviewers. Reviewer pairs resolved any disagreements about full-text eligibility via discussion, conferring with a third reviewer (EETS) as needed. We recorded reasons for excluding citations at the full-text stage. Rather than excluding overlapping but eligible systematic reviews at this stage, we identified and managed any overlap in the populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes of included systematic reviews at later stages of the review (i.e., data collection and analysis). 2.5 Data Collection Process and Items We used standardized forms in FileMaker Pro for the data collection process based on a data collection codebook with all variables for which data were sought. Variables included bibliographic information (e.g., authors, year published), information related to the review question (i.e., population, interventions, comparators, outcomes, and settings), and methodological characteristics (e.g., risks of bias). In a revision to our protocol, we also collected information directly from eligible primary studies (rather than relying on information reported in systematic reviews about primary studies). Our primary outcome is depression diagnosis. Our secondary outcomes are subsyndromal depression and depressive symptoms. Our tertiary outcomes are anxiety, educational achievement and attainment, self-harm, self-medication, stress, substance use, suicidal ideation, and wellbeing. We collected all outcome data compatible with one of the above domains from all eligible primary studies (Gates et al., 2022). We provided reviewers with a FileMaker Pro instruction manual for using our standardized forms to collect data. After training in the data collection codebook (led by SG) and FileMaker Pro software (led by SDT and EETS), two reviewers (a combination of SG and either ED, EETS, or MSC) independently collected data from eligible systematic reviews and primary studies. Reviewer pairs resolved any disagreements about data collection via discussion, conferring with a third reviewer as needed. SG and EETS discussed and decided on any additions, modifications, or clarifications to the codebook after the data collection process commenced. 2.6 Risk of Bias After training in the assessment criteria (led by SG) and FileMaker Pro software (led by SDT and EETS), two reviewers (a combination of SG and either ED, EETS, or MSC) independently assessed the methodological quality of systematic reviews using AMSTAR-2 (Shea et al., 2017), risk of bias in systematic reviews using ROBIS (Whiting et al., 2016), and the risk of bias of primary studies using the RoB 2 for randomized trials (J. A. C. Sterne et al., 2019) and ROBINS-I for nonrandomized trials (J. A. Sterne et al., 2016). 2.7 Synthesis Methods We narratively summarized descriptive information about eligible systematic reviews and primary studies. We quantified the overlap of primary studies across systematic reviews using Corrected Covered Area (CCA) calculations (Bougioukas et al., 2022) and visualized overlap using a citation matrix and CCA pairwise tables (Pieper et al., 2014). To estimate intervention effectiveness, we conducted random effects meta-analyses with a robust variance estimation approach using data that we extracted from eligible primary studies included in eligible systematic reviews (Tanner-Smith et al., 2016). We assessed the extent of heterogeneity statistically using \\(I^2\\) and \\(\\tau^2\\). We estimated the probability that the true effect of school-based depression prevention interventions will be null or higher in a new study using the cumulative distribution function for the t-distribution (IntHout et al., 2016). We also conducted meta-regressions to investigate sources of statistical heterogeneity in effect estimates by baseline differences in depression symptoms, race/ethnicity, grade/school level, school type, geographic region/country, level of prevention, cultural specificity of interventions, comparator type, study/publication year, and risk of bias. We report effect estimates as standardized mean differences for continuous data and risk ratios for dichotomous data. Narrative statements to communicate findings for each meta-analytic effect estimate are based on guidance from the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (Santesso et al., 2020). "],["results.html", "3 Results 3.1 Characteristics of Included Systematic Reviews 3.2 Characteristics of Eligible Primary Studies 3.3 Effects of Interventions in Eligible Primary Studies 3.4 Variation in Effects by Methodological, Demographic, and Intervention Characteristics", " 3 Results Our search yielded 4,784 citations (see Figure 1). We retained 562 citations (11.7%) for full-text eligibility assessment. Of the 562 full-texts assessed, we identified 24 eligible systematic reviews (4.3% of full-texts assessed for eligibility; 0.5% of all citations identified in our search). These 24 systematic reviews included 450 primary studies. After assessing the full texts of these 450 primary studies, we identified 70 (15.6%) that met our eligibility criteria. In summary, we included 24 systematic reviews and 70 primary studies in this overview. 3.1 Characteristics of Included Systematic Reviews Overall, these 24 reviews were published between 2006 and 2023, with a median publication year of 2017 (see Table 1). These reviews most commonly searched APA PsycInfo (23 reviews; 95.8%), MEDLINE only (10 reviews; 41.7%), PubMed (10 reviews; 41.7%), ERIC (9 reviews; 37.5%), and Cochrane Library (8 reviews; 33.3%) to identify primary studies. The year that each review last conducted their literature search ranged from 2007 to 2021, with a median of 2017. Regarding research transparency, 20 reviews (83.3%) included a flow diagram of information through the different phases of a systematic review (Page et al., 2021), 8 reviews (33.3%) reported a registration number for their review (Booth et al., 2012), and 4 reviews (16.7%) provided statements about the data and code underlying the review (Page et al., 2022). 3.1.1 Methodological Quality and Risk of Bias of Included Systematic Reviews AMSTAR-2 assessments (see Table 2) yielded methodological quality ratings of low for 2 reviews (8.3%) and critically low for 22 reviews (91.7%). The most common critical weaknesses in methodological quality were not providing justification for excluding individual studies (20 reviews; 83.3%), not registering a protocol prior to conducting the review (16 reviews; 66.7%), and inadequate literature search process (15 reviews; 62.5%). The most common non-critical weaknesses in methodological quality were not reporting funding sources for included studies (24 reviews; 100%), not assessing the impact of risk of bias in individual studies on evidence synthesis results (15 reviews; 62.5%), and not explaining the selection criteria used to identify included study designs (15 reviews; 62.5%). ROBIS assessments (see Table 3) yielded ratings of low risk of bias for 3 reviews (12.5%), unclear risk of bias for 1 review (4.2%), and high risk of bias for 20 reviews (83.3%). Concerns about risk of bias were most commonly related to study eligibility criteria (21 reviews; 83.3%) and synthesis and findings (19 reviews; 79.2%). 3.1.2 Overlap of Primary Studies Across Systematic Reviews The number of primary studies included in each review ranged from 9 to 137, with a median of 38. Of the 450 primary studies included across all reviews, 158 studies (35.1%) were included in more than one review (see Figure 2). Of the 70 primary studies meeting our eligibility criteria, 47 studies (67.1%) were included in more than one review (see Figure 3). The overall CCA percentage for all primary studies included across reviews (6.8%) was lower than the overall CCA percentage for primary studies meeting our eligibility criteria (19.2%). These numbers indicate only moderate overlap across reviews in all primary studies, though very high overlap across reviews in primary studies eligible for our overview (i.e., school-based depression prevention delivered directly to students during school hours). Importantly, no single review identified all primary studies eligible for our overviewincluding reviews directly focused on school-based depression prevention (Caldwell et al., 2019b; Werner-Seidler et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022) as opposed to reviews that had a more general remit (e.g., depression prevention across all ages and settings). 3.1.3 Findings from Eligible Systematic Reviews Meta-analyses from previous reviews have generally found that school-based depression prevention interventions may have modest positive impacts on depression. Several reviews found positive impacts of school-based depression prevention interventions for children and adolescents in general (Cowen, 2014; Davaasambuu et al., 2020; Mychailyszyn, 2011; van Zoonen et al., 2014; Werner-Seidler et al., 2021), though some cautioned more heavily that effects were modest and the evidence not robust (Caldwell et al., 2021). In terms of school level, Havlik (2020) found school-based mental health interventions to have small effects on depression for secondary students. In terms of stages of prevention, Johnstone et al.¬†(2018) and Ahlen et al.¬†(2015) both found that universal school-based prevention programs led to significantly fewer depressive symptoms, Gee et al.¬†(2020) found that indicated school-based interventions had a small effect on reducing depression symptoms, and Garber et al.¬†(2016) found positive effects in targeted samples. In terms of types of intervention, reviews specifically found positive impacts on depression for resilience-focused interventions (Dray et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2020), third-wave (Caldwell et al., 2021) and mindfulness interventions (Reangsing et al., 2021), and cognitive-behavioral approaches (Kavanagh et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2022)including in a group-format (Ssegonja et al., 2019) with a psycho-education component (Caldwell et al., 2021), or with hopeful elements (Venning et al., 2009). Two reviews had conflicting findings on whether specifically the Penn Resiliency Program did (Brunwasser et al., 2009) or did not (Bastounis et al., 2016) have a positive impact on depression. In terms of participant age, Feiss et al.¬†(2019) found school-based depression prevention programs significantly reduced depressive symptoms for adolescents. Horowitz &amp; Garber (2006) and Stockings et al.¬†(2016) found that universal, selective, and indicated prevention programs for young people reduce depression symptoms and the relative risk for a depression disorder, respectively; while they included programs in non-school settings, the majority of studies took place in schools. Looking across several of these moderators, Caldwell et al.¬†(2021) found weak evidence supporting the use of cognitive-behavioral interventions (alone and with interpersonal therapy) in universal secondary school settings, while Zhang et al.¬†(2022) concluded that secondary schools should strive to implement cognitive-behavioral interventions delivered through clinicians where possible. However, reviews generally noted concerns about study quality, heterogeneity, and (in some instances) publication bias in this body of evidence (Caldwell et al., 2021; Werner-Seidler et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022). In addition, no review provided meta-analyses that matched our specific eligibility criteria for primary studies, leading to the following information and meta-analyses to confirm whether findings were similar for eligible primary studies across all reviews. 3.2 Characteristics of Eligible Primary Studies The 70 primary studies on interventions delivered during school hours (see Table 4) were published between 1993 and 2020 (with a median of 2011). Start dates for participant recruitment ranged from 1989 to 2016 (with a median of 2008); end dates for completing data collection ranged from 1993 to 2017 (with a median of 2009). Unless otherwise indicated, the percentages below include all studies in the denominator (including those with missing data). 3.2.1 Study Design Regarding number of interventions and comparisons trialed per study, 53 studies (75.7%) had two groups, 12 studies (17.1%) had three groups, and 5 studies (7.1%) had four groups. In terms of study design, 27 studies (38.6%) randomized individual students to interventions, 36 studies (51.4%) randomized clusters of students to interventions, and 7 studies (10%) used non-random assignment. Of the 36 cluster-randomized trials, 19 studies (52.8%) randomized classrooms, and 17 studies (47.2%) randomized schools. Among the cluster-randomized trials reporting this information, the average cluster size ranged from 11 to 114 (with a median of 22.9). Regarding research transparency, 38 studies (54.3%) included a flow diagram of participants through the different phases of the study, 14 studies (100%) reported a registration number for their study, and 12 studies (17.1%) provided statements about the data and code underlying the results that they reported. 3.2.2 Participants The 70 included primary studies included 45,519 students (median: 209 students per study, range: 15 to 5,634), 332 classrooms (median: 13 classrooms per study, range: 0 to 66), and 570 schools (median: 4 schools per study, range: 1 to 63). The average age of students ranged from 8.8 to 17.3 (with a median of 13.6). Regarding school level, 14 studies (20.0%) took place in primary/elementary school, 15 studies (21.4%) took place in intermediate/middle school, and 39 studies (55.7%) took place in secondary/high school. The most common grade levels were 1st grade (32 studies; 45.7%), 9th grade (25 studies; 35.7%), 7th grade (19 studies; 27.1%), 8th grade (18 studies; 25.7%), and 10th grade (16 studies; 22.9%). The average percentage of students who were female ranged from 0% to 100% (with a median of 52.5%). Of the 22 studies conducted in the United States, the average percentage of students who were white ranged from 0% to 98.9% (with a median of 61.9%). No studies conducted in the United States reported the percentage of English language learners. Two studies reported the percentage of students receiving free or reduced price lunch: P√∂ssel et al.¬†(2013) had 29% and McLaughlin (2010) had 46%. 3.2.3 Settings Studies took place in Australia (25 studies; 35.7%), United States (22 studies; 31.4%), United Kingdom (4 studies; 5.7%), and Netherlands (3 studies; 4.3%). Of the 22 studies conducted in the United States, the most common states were Pennsylvania (5 studies; 27.3%) and Washington (2 studies; 9.1%). Of the 39 studies (55.7%) reporting information on area type, 14 studies (35.9%) took place in rural areas, 26 studies (66.7%) took place in urban areas, and 6 studies (15.4%) took place in suburban areas. Of the 31 studies (44.3%) reporting information on school type, 24 studies (77.4%) took place in public schools, 13 studies (41.9%) took place in private schools, and 1 study (3.2%) took place in charter schools. 3.2.4 Experimental Interventions Across all 70 primary studies, 84 experimental interventions were evaluated. Regarding format of the 84 experimental interventions, 10 (11.9%) were administered to individual students, 41 (48.8%) were administered to small groups, 32 (38.1%) were administered to whole classes, and 1 (1.2%) was administered to whole schools. The duration of interventions ranged from 0.14 to 104 weeks (with a median of 8), the number of sessions ranged from 1 to 30 sessions (with a median of 9), and the length of each session ranged from 25 to 120 minutes (with a median of 50). Of the 59 interventions for which frequency of intervention delivery was reported, 4 interventions (6.8%) were delivered less than weekly, 50 interventions (84.7%) were delivered once a week, 4 interventions (6.8%) were delivered 2-4 times a week, and 1 intervention (1.7%) involved daily contact. Of the 81 interventions for which provider information was reported, 31 interventions (38.3%) by behavioral health personnel, 30 interventions (37.0%) by researchers, 24 interventions (29.6%) were delivered by teachers, 8 (9.9%) were self-administered, 3 interventions (3.7%) by guidance counselors, 4 interventions (4.9%) by other school personnel, and 8 interventions (9.9%) by other providers. Of the 84 interventions for which recipient information was reported, all interventions (100%) were delivered directly to students, 10 interventions (11.9%) to family, 1 intervention (1.2%) to peers, 1 intervention (1.2%) to teachers, 1 intervention (1.2%) to staff, and 1 intervention (1.2%) to the community. In addition to delivery during school hours, 7 interventions (8.3%) also involved a component that took place out-of-school time but on school groups (e.g., after school), 6 interventions (7.1%) involved a component that took place at home, and 1 intervention (1.2%) involved a component that took place in the community. Of the 83 interventions for which intervention mode was reported, 78 interventions (94.0%) involved in-person delivery, 9 interventions (10.8%) involved digital delivery, and no interventions (0%) involved phone delivery. Across the 70 primary studies, 49 (70.0%) reported monitoring intervention implementation to assess delivery as intended, and 10 (14.3%) reported that there was uncontrolled variation or degradation in intervention implementation. 3.2.5 Comparison Interventions Overall, the 70 primary studies had 77 comparison interventions. Of these 74 comparison interventions, 33 (42.9%) involved business-as-usual, 16 (20.8%) involved no intervention, 10 (13.0%) involved a wait-list control, 9 (11.7%) involved a different active intervention, and 7 (9.1%) involved an attention-control intervention. 3.2.6 Risks of Bias Of the 27 individually-randomized trials, we rated 15 studies (55.6%) as high risk of bias and 12 studies (44.4%) as having some concerns. Concerns about risk of bias were most commonly related to missing outcome data (10 studies; 37%), random allocation (5 studies; 18.5%), selective reporting (3 studies; 18.5%), and assignment/adherence deviation (2 studies; 7.4%). Of the 36 cluster-randomized trials, we rated 22 studies (61.1%) as high risk of bias and 14 studies (38.9%) as having some concerns. Concerns about risk of bias were most commonly related to missing outcome data (16 studies; 44.4%), assignment/adherence deviation (10 studies; 27.8%), measurement (5 studies; 13.9%), and recruitment (3 studies; 8.3%). Of the 7 non-randomized trials, we rated 4 studies (57.1%) as serious risk of bias and 3 studies (42.9%) as having moderate risk of bias. Serious or critical concerns about risk of bias were most commonly related to confounding (4 studies; 57.1%). 3.3 Effects of Interventions in Eligible Primary Studies We were able to conduct meta-analyses for depression diagnosis, depression symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. We provide narrative findings for subsyndromal depression, educational achievement, self-harm, stress, substance use, suicidal ideation, and well-being. 3.3.1 Depression Diagnosis Twelve studies (17.1%) comprised of 9,838 students (20.1%) reported data on depression diagnosis that could be used in meta-analysis. These studies measured depression diagnosis through either Childrens Depression Inventory (3 studies; 25%), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (2 studies; 16.7%), structured clinical interviews (2 studies; 16.7%), Beck Depression Inventory (1 study; 8.3%), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (1 study; 8.3%), Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents (1 study; 8.3%), Major Depression Inventory (1 study; 8.3%), and Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (1 study; 8.3%). Length of follow-up for outcome measurement ranged from 0 to 78.2 weeks post-intervention (with a median of 26.1 weeks). Each study provided 1 to 6 effect estimates (median = 2, total = 33). Students receiving depression prevention interventions had a 33% reduced risk of meeting criteria for a depression diagnosis relative to students in control groups (risk ratio = 0.67, 95% CI [0.48 to 0.93], 95% PI [0.27 to 1.66], \\(I^2\\) = 67%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.14). Using 17% (170 per 1,000) for the assumed baseline risk of experiencing a major depressive episode in the past year (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2021), this relative risk reduction translates into 56 [12 to 88] fewer students meeting criteria for a depression diagnosis per every 1,000 who received a depression prevention intervention rather than a comparator, or a number needed to prevent of 18 [11 to 85]. However, the prediction interval indicates that the possible underlying effect in a new study could range from a risk ratio of 0.27 to 1.66 (i.e., 27% to 166% as likely to meet criteria for a depression diagnosis). The estimated probability that the true effect of school-based depression prevention interventions on depression diagnosis will be null or better in a new study was 82.7%. 3.3.2 Subsyndromal Depression Three studies (4.3%) comprised of 1,674 students (3.8%) reported meta-analyzable data on subsyndromal depression. However, the degrees of freedom are below the threshold to use robust variance estimation (Tipton, 2015), so results are reported narratively. These studies measured subsyndromal depression through the Childrens Depression Inventory (2 studies; 66.7%) and the Revised Childrens Attributional Style Questionnaire (1 study; 33.3%). The length of follow-up for outcome measurement ranged from 0 to 104.3 weeks post-intervention (with a median of 16 weeks). Each study provided 2 to 5 effect estimates for subsyndromal depression (median = 2, total = 9). All three studies did not find a statistically significant difference between intervention and comparison group students in subsyndromal depression. OKearney et al.¬†(2006) found no significant differences between intervention and comparison groups in the proportion of high vulnerability status at post-intervention (odds ratio = 1.30) and 16-week follow-up (odds ratio = 1.56). Pophillat et al.¬†(2016) reported no significant difference between intervention and comparison groups in the proportion of students who moved from healthy at pre-test to at-risk at post-test (odds ratio = 1.17, 95% CI [0.49, 2.82], p = 0.719) nor those who moved from at-risk at pre-test to healthy at post-test (odds ratio = 1.00, 95% CI [0.42, 2.40], p = 0.997). Tak et al.¬†(2016) did not find a statistically significant difference between intervention and comparison groups in the prevalence of an elevated level of depressive symptoms at post-intervention (odds ratio = 0.50, 95% CI [0.90, 3.02], p=.102) or 1-year follow-up (odds ratio = 1.00, 95% CI [0.60, 1.65], p=.992). We could not conduct analyses to examine sources of heterogeneity in underlying effects due to a limited number of studies. 3.3.3 Depression Symptoms Sixty studies (85.7%) comprised of 37,705 students (84.7%) reported data on depression symptoms that could be used in meta-analysis. These studies measured depression symptoms through the Childrens Depression Inventory (25 studies; 41.7%), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (16 studies; 26.7%), Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (6 studies; 10%), Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (5 studies; 8.3%), Beck Depression Inventory (4 studies; 6.7%), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (4 studies; 6.7%), Reynolds Child Depression Scale (2 studies; 3.6%), Revised Childrens Depression Rating Scale (1 study; 1.7%), Cuestionario de Depresi√≥n para Ni√±os (1 study; 1.7%), Major Depression Inventory (1 study; 1.7%), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (1 study; 1.7%); Peer Nomination Inventory for Depression (1 study; 1.7%), Revised Childrens Anxiety and Depression Scale (1 study; 1.7%), Selbstbeurteilungsbogen-Depressive Stoerungen (1 study; 1.7%), and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders 1 study; 1.7%). The length of follow-up for outcome measurement ranged from 0 to 234.6 weeks post-intervention (with a median of 26.1 weeks). Each study provided 1 to 18 effect estimates for depression symptoms (median = 3, total = 239). We found that intervention group students had lower depression symptoms relative to students in control groups (standardized mean difference = -0.12, 95% CI [-0.20, -0.04], 95% PI [-0.57, 0.33], \\(I^2\\) = 71%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.05). Using empirically-based benchmarks (Tanner-Smith et al., 2018), this effect size represents a medium effect equal to the 50th percentile of the distribution of mean effects obtained for universal prevention programs focused on internalizing problems among school-aged youth. However, the prediction interval indicates that the possible underlying effect in a new study could range from a standardized mean difference of -0.57 to 0.33 (i.e., a large positive effect to a negative effect). The estimated probability that the true effect of school-based depression prevention interventions on depression symptoms will be null or lower in a new study was 69.8%. 3.3.4 Anxiety Symptoms Twenty-three studies (32.9%) comprised of 20,386 students (45.8%) reported data on anxiety symptoms that could be used in meta-analysis. These studies measured anxiety symptoms through the Revised Childrens Manifest Anxiety Scale (6 studies; 26.1%), Spence Childrens Anxiety Scale (5 studies; 21.7%), Revised Childrens Anxiety and Depression Scale (3 studies; 13.0%), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (2 studies; 8.7%), Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (2 studies; 8.7%), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (2 studies; 8.7%), Escala de Ansiedad para Ni√±os (1 study; 4.4%), Childrens Automatic Thoughts Scale (1 study; 4.4%), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (1 study; 4.4%). The length of follow-up for outcome measurement ranged from 0 to 234.6 weeks post-intervention (with a median of 26.1 weeks). Each study provided 1 to 32 effect estimates for anxiety symptoms (median = 2, total = 104). We found that the average effect of students receiving depression prevention interventions was lower anxiety symptoms relative to students in control groups (standardized mean difference = -0.06, 95% CI [-0.15, 0.03], 95% PI [-0.34, 0.22], \\(I^2\\) = 46%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.02). Using empirically-based benchmarks (Tanner-Smith et al., 2018), this effect size is potentially trivial, as it is less than the 25th percentile of the distribution of mean effects obtained for universal prevention programs focused on internalizing problems among school-aged youth. In addition, the data are consistent with an average effect of trivially higher anxiety symptoms among students receiving depression prevention interventions relative to students in control groups (i.e., an upper 95% CI of 0.03). In addition, the prediction interval indicates that the possible underlying effect in a new study could range from a standardized mean difference of -0.34 to 0.22 (i.e., a medium positive effect to a negative effect). 3.3.5 Educational Achievement Two studies (2.9%) comprised of 1,930 students (4.3%) reported meta-analyzable data on educational achievement. However, the degrees of freedom are below the threshold to use robust variance estimation (Tipton, 2015), so results are reported narratively. Perry et al.¬†(2017) reported data on the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank and found that academic outcomes did not differ between the intervention and comparison groups at 40-weeks post-intervention (p = 0.41). Tak et al.¬†(2016) reported data on the last grades students obtained on a variety of subject-specific tests. They found students to in the depression prevention program to have slightly lower school grades than the comparison group immediately at post-intervention (p &lt; 0.001), though no differences were found at two-year follow-up (p = 0.112). 3.3.6 Self-Harm One study (1.1%) comprised of 5,030 students (11.3%) reported meta-analyzable data on self-harm. However, the degrees of freedom are below the threshold to use robust variance estimation (Tipton, 2015), so results are reported narratively. Stallard et al.¬†(2012) reported data on self-harming thoughts and self-harming behaviors at 6- and 12-months post-intervention. Among students at high risk of depression at baseline, they found a potentially beneficial effect of classroom-based cognitive behavioral therapy (relative to usual school provision) on self-harming thoughts at 6-months post-intervention, though they found no significant differences at 12-months post-intervention, relative to an attention control, and on self-harming behaviors. 3.3.7 Stress Three studies (4.3%) comprised of 1305 students (2.9%) reported meta-analyzable data on stress. However, the degrees of freedom are below the threshold to use robust variance estimation (Tipton, 2015), so results are reported narratively. Singhal et al.¬†(2014) did not find significant differences between intervention and comparison groups on the Scale for Assessing Academic Stress immediately at post-intervention and at 3-month follow-up. Wong et al.¬†(2012) also found no significant differences between intervention and comparison groups on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale immediately at post-intervention. Similarly, Wong et al.¬†(2014) found no significant differences between intervention and comparison groups on the six-item short form of the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale immediately at post-intervention. 3.3.8 Substance Use One study (1.4%) comprised of 5,030 students (11.3%) reported meta-analyzable data on self-harm. However, the degrees of freedom are below the threshold to use robust variance estimation (Tipton, 2015), so results are reported narratively. Among students at high risk of depression at baseline, Stallard et al.¬†(2012) found no significant differences between the intervention and comparison groups on alcohol, cannabis, and street drug misuse at 12-months post-intervention. 3.3.9 Suicidal Ideation One study (1.4%) comprised of 540 students (1.2%) reported meta-analyzable data on suicidal ideation. However, the degrees of freedom are below the threshold to use robust variance estimation (Tipton, 2015), so results are reported narratively. Perry et al.¬†(2017) found no significant differences between the intervention and comparison group on suicidal ideation immediately, 6-months, and 18-months post-intervention. 3.3.10 Well-being Three studies (4.3%) comprised of 1,018 students (2.3%) reported meta-analyzable data on well-being. However, the degrees of freedom are below the threshold to use robust variance estimation (Tipton, 2015), so results are reported narratively. All three studies measured well-being using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS). Brown et al.¬†(2019) found the intervention group to score 3.57 (95% CI [1.37 to 5.76]) points higher on the WEMWBS than the control group at 3-month post-intervention; in absolute terms, the average control group score is indicative of low well-being, while the average intervention group score was above this threshold. Both Johnson et al.¬†(2016) and Johnson et al.¬†(2017) found no significant differences between the intervention and comparison group on suicidal ideation immediately and at 3-months post-intervention. 3.4 Variation in Effects by Methodological, Demographic, and Intervention Characteristics We examined heterogeneity in effect estimates for depression symptoms using the following pre-specified factors: risk of bias, baseline differences in depression symptoms, school level, school type, country, level of prevention, comparator type, and study/publication year. We also examined heterogeneity based on whether a study involved randomization to experimental and comparator groups. Studies insufficiently reported race/ethnicity, percent female, and cultural specificity of interventions to examine this pre-specified factor in meta-regressions. No meta-regressions reduced unexplained residual heterogeneity variance nor variability due to between-study heterogeneity, and we did not detect associations between depression symptoms and any of our pre-specified predictors: type of assignment to interventions (SMD = -0.13, 95% CI [-0.40 to 0.14], \\(I^2\\) = 70%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.05), high risk of bias (SMD = -0.01, 95% CI [-0.16 to 0.14], \\(I^2\\) = 72%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.05), baseline depression symptoms (SMD = 0.01, 95% CI [-0.92 to 0.95], \\(I^2\\) = 72%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.05), school level (SMD = -0.14, 95% CI [-0.29 to 0.01], \\(I^2\\) = 71%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.05), school type (SMD = -0.13, 95% CI [-0.41 to 0.15], \\(I^2\\) = 78%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.09), country (SMD = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.12 to 0.18], \\(I^2\\) = 71%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.05), level of prevention (SMD = 0.04, 95% CI [-0.12 to 0.20], \\(I^2\\) = 71%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.05), type of comparator (SMD = 0.12, 95% CI [-0.08 to 0.31], \\(I^2\\) = 70%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.05), and publication year (SMD = -0.00, 95% CI [-0.02 to 0.01], \\(I^2\\) = 71%, \\(\\tau^2\\) = 0.05). "],["conclusions.html", "4 Conclusions", " 4 Conclusions We identified 24 eligible systematic reviews that included 450 primary studies overall; of these, 70 primary studies evaluated 84 active interventions delivered directly to 44,519 students during normal school hours. Findings suggest that school-based depression prevention interventions may reduce the risk of depression diagnosis and severity of depression symptoms. Interventions delivered during school hours may have little to no average effect on anxiety symptoms, though the evidence is very uncertain. Our confidence in meta-analytic findings is reduced by the number of studies with plausible explanations other than differences in interventions received (i.e., risks of bias). For anxiety symptoms, our confidence is also reduced by imprecision (i.e., a confidence interval that includes average effects of both reduced and increased anxiety symptoms). Moreover, there is substantial unexplained heterogeneity in study effect estimates and wide prediction intervals. Consequently, while the evidence suggests schools implementing these interventions in contexts similar to those in the review are more likely than not to see improvements in depression diagnoses and symptoms, users of this evidence should be aware that current research evidence suggests both positive and negative effects are possible. We could not conduct meta-analyses for other tertiary outcomes. Strengths of this review include the use of explicit research questions and eligibility criteria, prospective registration of the review protocol, eligibility assessment and data collection in duplicate, use of established techniques to assess risk of bias, and use of meta-analytic techniques that include all (dependent) effect sizes reported in eligible primary studies (even when the exact form of the dependence is unknown). Potential ways to improve the strengths of this review are to supplement our literature search for systematic review (e.g., grey and non-English literature sources) and conduct our own supplemental search for primary studies.

The lower age limit was set in accordance with the de facto school starting age in England and Wales. However, owing to global differences in school starting age, we determined that studies implemented in preschool settings would be eligible for inclusion if (1) the mean age of participants was 5 years or (2) the majority of enrolled children were aged 5 years at the time of the baseline assessment. The upper age limit reflects the minimum age of entry to higher (tertiary) education in England and Wales. However, studies were eligible for inclusion if the mean age of participants at baseline was  19 years. Studies targeted at young people not in education or training were excluded. Young people at risk of comorbid mental health disorders were eligible for inclusion. However, we excluded studies for which > 40% of participants had an identifiable or pre-existing mental disorder. To ensure a clinically homogeneous population for analysis, studies in which the whole population had a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or an autism spectrum disorder were excluded, as these form distinct diagnostic categories. Interventions Studies were included if they were explicitly aimed at the primary prevention of anxiety, depression [and/or conduct disorder] as operationalised according to categorical or clinically referenced definitions of disorder [e.g. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)]. This was to differentiate studies addressing related mental health constructs, such as emotional health or well-being, which were excluded (see Interventions and comparators). Studies were eligible if they focused on either prevention of disorder onset or prevention of symptoms. Interventions were eligible for inclusion if they addressed a universal, selective or indicated population, and the primary study aim was to prevent anxiety, depression [or conduct disorder]. We followed the NAMs definition of primary prevention, which refers to universal, selective and indicated populations (see Figure 1). Briefly, universal prevention addresses whole populations not defined on the basis of risk; selective prevention is targeted at subgroups with a higher than average risk of developing a mental disorder; and indicated prevention is targeted at high-risk subgroups and/or individuals with detectable, but subclinical, symptoms of a mental disorder. In the first instance, we used authorreported classifications of the intended prevention level. However, when interventions were delivered to a whole class or school with the same at-risk characteristic (such as schools in low-income areas), they were combined with universal prevention. Studies that addressed individual symptoms, or combinations of symptoms, associated with anxiety, depression and conduct disorder, but without explicitly linking these to a clinically identifiable disorder, were excluded. For example, interventions to prevent insomnia, rumination or low self-esteem were excluded, even though these symptoms are associated with depressive and/or anxiety disorders, and interventions to prevent truancy, bullying or aggressive behaviour were excluded, even though these behaviours are associated symptoms of conduct disorder. - Unless the study was explicitly focused on disorder-specific prevention, then mental health promotion, awareness, literacy or information interventions were not eligible for inclusion. Social and emotional well-being and positive psychology interventions to improve mental well-being were also excluded, as research suggests that well-being is a separate construct to mental ill health. Interventions designed to target prevention of behaviours or social problems that might be on the causal pathway to a mental disorder (e.g. prevention of stress, anti-bullying interventions, substance abuse prevention) were also excluded. We excluded interventions aiming to help children and young people manage the consequences of a specific event or situation (eg, divorce, exams). Similarly, classroom management and school readiness interventions were not eligible. - Parenting interventions such as parent management training or parenting skills interventions were not eligible for inclusion. However, interventions that took place in schools, with a parenting component, were eligible if the parenting component was not > 50% of the whole intervention. Studies were included only if they addressed the whole condition, not individual symptoms or combinations of associated symptoms. - Studies were excluded if the intervention was described by the author as indicated prevention, but baseline symptoms scores were suggestive of clinically meaningful symptom levels. Studies in indicated populations were eligible if participants had subclinical mental disorder symptoms as identified by a screening instrument, an interview or a teacher referral. Subclinical symptoms could be defined in reference to diagnostic criteria such as the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)- or DSM-5-categorised disorders, or in research via use of a disorder-specific screening instrument, for example the Childrens Depression Inventory or Revised Childrens Manifest Anxiety Scale. The boundary between indicated prevention and early intervention (treatment) is debated,26,27 with no definitive diagnostic threshold. Studies were excluded if baseline measures were suggestive of clinically meaningful symptoms in > 40% of participants, even if the study had been defined as indicated prevention by the author. Eligible intervention types included psychological and psychosocial, educational or physical interventions that were implemented in educational settings, either individually or in groups. Inclusion was not restricted by mode of delivery. Interventions were included if delivered by peer educators, teachers, youth workers, clinicians, health visitors, school nurses or counsellors. Digital and online interventions were eligible for inclusion only if they were primarily delivered in the education setting or were a clear adjunct to a wider programme delivered in the school/educational setting (e.g. as homework). Comparisons All relevant non-pharmacological control interventions were considered eligible for inclusion, for example standard provision/usual curriculum, waiting list, no intervention, attention control or placebo interventions, and other active psychological and psychosocial, educational or physical interventions. Outcomes All validated disease-specific measurement scales ... were eligible for inclusion. When studies reported multiple outcome measures, we applied a prespecified hierarchy to select the most appropriate outcome for analysis from each study (see Appendix 1). We did not exclude studies reporting a composite mental health scale from the systematic review [e.g. the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)]; however, they were not combined with disorder-specific scales in the main NMA. Timing Not reported Setting Interventions implemented in an educational setting were eligible for inclusion. For the purposes of analysis, this was operationalised as being primary, secondary or tertiary educational settings. However, to accommodate global differences in educational systems, we did not restrict to interventions implemented in these settings if the age eligibility criteria were met. For example, an intervention delivered in a kindergarten setting would be eligible for inclusion if the mean age of participants was 5 years, or the majority of enrolled children were aged 5 years at the time of the baseline assessment. Interventions implemented in school-affiliated settings (e.g. after-school and holiday clubs) were eligible for inclusion if they were implemented on school grounds. Studies that used schools as the source of recruitment but for which the intervention was not school based were excluded. Health service settings, such as primary care and outpatient and inpatient settings, were excluded. Interventions implemented in young offender institutions and for looked-after children in residential care were also excluded. Interventions implemented in low-income countries (LICs), middle-income countries (MICs) or high-income countries (HICs) were eligible, as defined by 2017 World Bank classifications. Studies Parallel-group RCTs and quasi-randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. We defined quasi-randomised trials as those for which allocation was based on a pseudo-random sequence, such as the order in which participants were recruited or their date of birth. Both individually randomised and cluster randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. We did not plan to exclude crossover trials, but only the first period was considered eligible for inclusion.

All included participants were symptomatic: that is, they were seeking help for symptoms of depression or anxiety and/or were presenting with depression or anxiety symptoms deemed to exceed a threshold for intervention prespecified by the trial team. Interventions The trial intervention was a manualised psychological intervention. If a multi-component intervention, the psychological component constituted at least 75% of the content. The trial intervention was designed primarily to decrease symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. Since the focus of this review was indicated interventions, trials of universal (whole-school) approaches or integrated universal-indicated programmes were not eligible for inclusion unless they also included an indicated intervention only arm. Comparisons Studies with any control condition, either active or passive, will be eligible. Outcomes Trials were only included if we were able to obtain sufficient outcome data for meta-analysis (either from the published report or by contacting the corresponding author). Timing Randomised controlled trials with follow-up of any length will be eligible for inclusion. Setting The trial intervention was delivered wholly or partly within an institution whose primary function was education. Trials conducted in high, middle and low income countries will be eligible for inclusion. Trials of interventions delivered in universities or other higher education institutions were also ineligible. Trials of interventions delivered within non-mainstream education settings (e.g. pupil referral unit) will be eligible for inclusion provided they meet the above criteria.

Interventions The study assessed an intervention of resilience-oriented CBIs. We focused exclusively on a subtype of CBIs, which combine at least three core content areas: cognitive restructuring (with or without a module on behavioral activation), problem solving, and social skills training. Under this criterion, CBIs with limited content areas (e.g., cognitive restructuring only), interpersonal therapy, and third-wave cognitive behavioral therapy (e.g., mindfulness-based interventions), which might be promising in addressing depressive symptoms for students, were not included in the scope of this review. Programs that were primarily developed to target overall psychological well-being or other mental health issues (e.g., anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorders) were excluded, such as FRIENDS, REACH for RESILIENCE, and ERASE-Stress. Comparisons The study compared the intervention condition with a no-intervention, assessment-only, waiting list, attention control, or placebo control condition. To minimize the difficulty in understanding, head-to-head trials that compared the intervention with an active control condition such as psychological intervention, or physical exercise were excluded from this review. Outcomes The study evaluated depression as a primary outcome. The study used a validated measure for the assessment of depressive symptoms. Timing Not reported Setting School settings. Studies The study was a randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trial.

Interventions Interventions for anxiety or depression. Intervention must have been cognitive-behavioral in nature. The content of the intervention may have been delivered in any language. Comparisons Not reported Outcomes The study must have provided quantitative analyses of outcome data, with the specific statistical information needed for the calculation of effect sizes, or author contact information to obtain the additional data needed. Timing Not reported Setting Implemented within a school system. Studies The size of the samples under investigation had to be sufficiently large enough to allow for the types of statistical analyses required for meta-analytic purposes. Single-subject case studies were not included in this review. The study must have been written in English. In order to preserve assumptions of independence, studies were excluded if the sample under investigation overlapped either in whole or in part with the sample of participants from another study which met inclusion criteria. When this was suspected, authors were contacted to confirm participant sample overlap. In such instances where this was the case, the study conducted first temporally was chosen for inclusion, as youth who were included in later examinations were more likely to have entered with prior exposure to psychotherapeutic strategies.

Participants were aged between 5 and 18 years. Interventions The intervention of the included studies focused on the prevention of the onset of major depression, dysthymia, or an anxiety disorder [including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social phobia, agoraphobia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)] or, where the intervention included both prevention and treatment, data for prevention were reported separately in a usable form. Comparisons Employed a control group who received either no intervention, placebo, or usual care. Outcomes Outcome data were collected for at least one internalizing disorder and comprised either a clinical diagnosis of at least one internalizing disorder, or clinically relevant symptoms of at least one internalizing disorder as measured using validated symptom rating scales. The data are reported in a usable form, or usable data could be obtained from the study authors.

Interventions Preventive, psychological intervention on the incidence of new cases of depressive disorders. We included studies examining universal, selective and indicated prevention. Prevention was defined as reducing the incidence of new cases of MDD. Studies focusing on preventing depressive disorders after a specific live event (e.g. postnatal depression) were included.

Youth who reported baseline levels of depression below what is considered clinically significant (i.e. according to the psychological instrument that was used). Research that was targeted at or concerned with young people who had a pre-existing Axis I disorder (e.g. depression) or were considered to be at risk or diagnosed with an Axis II to Axis V disorder (as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual: Third Edition  Revised) were excluded. Interventions CBT to prevent the onset of depression in young people. However, as CBT is not a single therapy but rather a heterogeneous array of psychotherapies grouped under a common rubric, studies were included if they: (i) had between four (minimum) and 15 (maximum) sessions; (ii) had a follow-up period of between 3 (minimum) and 24 (maximum) months; and (iii) included at least one of the following psychological strategies: the identification of negative and irrational beliefs; the establishment of links between thoughts, feelings and behaviours; and/or the provision of tools to self-monitor thoughts, feelings and behaviours. Both universal and targeted interventions were included to determine the effectiveness of preventative CBT delivered to young people with varying levels of emotional and behavioural functioning. Comparisons Not reported Outcomes Outcomes: (i) the absence of depression in the CBT group at follow up (i.e. 3, 6, 12, 18 or 24 months), as indicated by scores below the clinical cut-off on the standardised psychological measures used; (ii) lower levels of depression at follow up reported by those in the CBT group compared with those in a control, no treatment or usual care group; or (iii) sustained lower levels of depression at follow up reported by those in the CBT group that contained multiple hopeful elements compared with a control, no treatment or usual care group, relative to the depression levels reported by those in the CBT groups that contained fewer hopeful elements.

Age was used to categorise participants according to whether they were children (b10 years), early adolescents (1014 years), or older adolescents (N14 years). Diagnostic status was not used to include or exclude participants, as a majority of school-based studies do not conduct a diagnostic assessment prior to program delivery. Interventions Included interventions were manualised psychological or psychoeducational programs, including individual, group or computerised interventions such as CBT (including relaxation and progressive muscle relaxation approaches), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), wellbeing therapy (WBT) and psycho-educational approaches. For multi-component programs, the psychological or educational component was required to constitute N75% of the programs' content. Studies were included if they used a program designed to prevent depressive or anxiety symptoms, and/or promote wellbeing. Studies evaluating drug and alcohol, physical activity, nutritional or pharmacological interventions were not eligible for inclusion. The program was required to be school-supported with recruitment occurring within and facilitated by the school. The school context could not simply provide the location for private/external programs to be delivered. There were no restrictions on whether participants were receiving other forms of therapy or medication. Comparisons Studies were included in which the effects of the school-based intervention was compared to either a no intervention control group or a school-as-usual control condition (NI), a waitlist control condition (WL), or an attention control condition/alternate educational/psychological condition (e.g., bibliotherapy; AC). Outcomes Studies were included if they reported symptoms of depression and/or anxiety at both baseline and post-intervention at a minimum. Outcome measures needed to be valid and reliable rating scales suitable for children and adolescents. Timing Reporting on follow-up outcomes was not required for inclusion in the current review. Waitlist control groups were required to remain waitlist for the follow-up assessment point for data to be extracted (e.g., waitlist groups could not be delivered the intervention prior to follow-up for follow-up data to be included). Setting Interventions needed to be school-based, which in this context refers to a program that is endorsed by the school and delivered in the classroom during school hours, or before or after school on school premises. For multi-setting studies (e.g., partly at school, partly at a primary health care setting), the school-based component needed to comprise >75% of the overall program. Studies Studies were eligible for inclusion if they used quantitative randomised controlled trial (RCT) methodology, including cluster RCTs. Studies were included if they were published in English language, peer-reviewed journals.

As per our previous review, age was used to categorise participants according to whether they were children (14 years). Interventions Included interventions were psychological or psycho-educational programs, including individual, group and face-to-face or digital interventions. For multi-component programs, the psychological or educational component was required to constitute >75% of the program content. The young person had to be the primary recipient of the intervention (i.e., programs targeted at parents or teachers were excluded). Studies were included if they used a program designed to prevent depressive or anxiety symptoms, and/or promote mental wellbeing. Studies evaluating drug and alcohol, physical activity, nutritional, or pharmacological interventions were not eligible for inclusion. Comparisons Studies were included in which the effect of the school-based intervention was compared to either a no-intervention control group or a school-as-usual control condition, a waitlist control condition, or an attention control condition/alternate educational/psychological condition. Outcomes Studies were included if they reported symptoms of depression and/ or anxiety at both baseline and post-intervention at a minimum. The two primary outcomes were depression and anxiety symptoms. Outcome measures needed to use valid and reliable rating scales suitable for children and adolescents. When more than one continuous measure was described, the primary outcome was used. If the primary outcome was not specified, the data from the measure reported first was extracted. Timing Reporting on follow up data was not required for inclusion in the current review.

This means that this study includes studies that focus on students studying in kindergarten, elementary, secondary (including middle and high schools). Interventions Program duration from program start to posttest must be at least four weeks to remove particularly short interventions. Intervention or instruction should be delivered by nonresearchers. Treatments had to be delivered by ordinary teachers, not by researchers, because effect sizes are inflated when researchers deliver the treatment. Comparisons A control group must be present. Outcomes Outcomes of interest measurements must include quantitative measures of either depression/depressive symptoms/depression literacy or anxiety/anxious symptoms. Timing Not reported Setting Studies must have taken place in the following countries: USA, Canada, Europe (European Union + U.K. + Switzerland + Norway), Israel, Australia, and New Zealand. This geographical restriction intends to narrow down the scope of review to countries that share similar economic and political situations. Studies Studies must use randomization to focus on studies of the highest level of internal validity. The level of random assignment may be schools, classes, or students. Randomized controlled trials must have at least 30 students per experimental condition to reduce bias in small studies and at least 2 teachers/schools per condition to eliminate confound due to sample size. Differences between conditions at baseline on depression/anxiety measure must be less than 0.25 standard deviations (SDs) to reduce bias from unreliable statistical analyses. Differential attrition between treatment and control groups must be less than 15% to reduce bias. Text must be available in English. Articles must be published on or after January 1st, 2000. This means that this study reviewed experimental studies in the last two decades for the most updated evidence.

The school psychologists informed the parents of anyone who scored over the 90th percentile on the CDI that their child was at considerable risk for clinical problems, and they were offered referrals to the Icelandic mental health system for further evaluation and/or treatment. Those who met the screening criteria and who agreed to participate were then interviewed to identify those who had a previous or current MDD, dysthymia, or other psychiatric disorders. Parents were informed and appropriate clinical referrals were offered when a student was diagnosed with current MDD, current substance abuse or dependence, psychotic symptoms, OCD, anorexia, or reported serious suicidal ideation or plans; no participants met criteria for dysthymia at the time of the initial interview. No significant problems were encountered with this system, and parents and school officials expressed satisfaction with this procedure, which they viewed as a valuable service. Eligibility Criteria Participants were selected as being at risk and invited for further participation if they scored between the 75th and 90th percentile on CDI or at the 75th percentile or higher on the negative composite of the CASQ (subjects who met one or both of these two criteria included all subjects who scored at the 75th percentile or higher on the CASQ-Positive Composite). We did not include individuals who scored higher than the 90th percentile on the CDI in the preliminary studies (even though they likely have the highest risk for development of MDD) because our primary purposes were program development and evaluation of the feasibility of implementation of the program. Furthermore, we did not have adequate psychiatric coverage to assure treatment as part of the project for individuals who were diagnosed with MDD at the pretest, and the rate of MDD is highest among individuals who score in the top 10% on the CDI (Kovacs, 1992). During the earlier pilot work and based on both ethical and practical reasons, it was decided to exclude students who met criteria for any major depression, dysthymia, bipolar disorder I or II, cyclothymia, anorexia, bulimia, psychotic disorder, alcohol or substance dependence, ADHD, ODD, or conduct disorder Research Design Randomized trial Assignment Level Individual Cluster Type NA Average Cluster Size NA Trial Arms 2 Sample Size 171 students Grade/School Level 9 / High School Age 14 (14 to 15) Percent Female 52% Percent Racce/Ethnicity Not reported Percent ELL Not reported Percent FRPL Not reported Country (State) Iceland Geographic Area Not reported School Type Not reported Active Intervention Prevention Program Comparison Group No Treatment Outcomes Depression diagnosis Risk of Bias Some Concerns Flow Diagram No Registration Not reported Data/Code Availability Not reported References Arnarson, E. √ñ., &amp; Craighead, W.

Approximately 85% in Lambeth and 76% of secondary school students in Southwark are from BME groups (Office for National Statistics, 2015). Schools were either approached directly or via a local network of head teachers and contact was then made with Heads of Sixth forms. In total, 16 schools were approached, 12 schools agreed to take part in the two boroughs but 2 did not proceed and 10 (62.5%) finally participated.\" Eligibility Criteria \"Eligible students were 1619 year olds recruited from Sixth forms i.e. academic years 12 and 13 in these schools. Participants needed to be fluent in English, not have severe learning difficulties, and be available to attend the scheduled one-day workshop. No clinical criteria were used but participants needed to refer themselves to the workshop. Participants judged as being at acute risk (i.e. in need of immediate mental health care) following a risk assessment were excluded.

Permission was also obtained from the principal of the middle school where the subjects were recruited. Teachers in the middle school were notified of the nature of the study and were given the opportunity to ask any questions or express any concerns they had regarding the study. A detailed letter was sent to the parents of all sixth grade students at the middle school informing them that their child may be participating in the learned optimism program. This letter described the nature of the learned optimism program and the nature of the research being conducted. It also indicated that parents must provide signed consent for their child to participate (see Appendices A, B, and C). Six parents denied permission.\" Eligibility Criteria \"The participants were divided into four groups. Placement into a group was determined by the class in which the student was enrolled during a particular class period (e.g., Social Studies, fifth period). All learned optimism groups met during fifth or sixth period. Group 1 was a treatment group (learned optimism program). Group 2 was an attention-placebo group. Group 3 was a delayed-treatment group, and Group 4 was a no-treatment control group.

Schools were recruited directly from the Australian Capital Territory, where the research team is located. Additional schools were recruited from a national mental health in-service program for teachers. The recruit-ment process resulted in a mix of public, private, coeducational, single-sex, metropolitan, and rural schools from six Australian states. Information and consent forms outlining the details of the trial and the schools assignment to either the intervention or the control condition were distributed to all participating students and their parents, with written informed consent required for the completion of questionnaires. A conservative estimate, based on classroom enrollments, suggests that approximately 52% of parents and students consented to participate in the trial. The consent rates within schools ranged from 32% to 100% in the intervention condition (Mdn  59%) and between 16% and 93% in the wait-list control condition (Mdn  50%). Eligibility Criteria Participants must: 1. Be students in Year 9 or 10; 2. Have access to the Internet during class time; 3. Be willing to participate in the study, as well as obtain parental consent.

Each of the 12 schools was then matched to another school in the data base in terms of SES, class size, and school size. Informed consent was obtained from 22 of the 24 schools (11 matched pairs). Active and passive consent of children and parentswas sought after the study was fully explained to them via information and consent forms. The first information and consent form required the active consent of participants, while those not responding to the first form were sent an additional information and consent form one week later seeking passive consent. This activeepassive consent process was aimed at increasing participation rates. Moreover, past researchers (e.g. Henry, Smith, &amp; Hopkins, 2002) have found that those children whose parents do not respond to active consent procedures may be more at risk of mental health problems than those who do return the forms, thus suggesting that the employment of an active consent only procedure may reduce the representativeness of the resulting sample. This activeepassive consent process resulted in parental consent being refused for 111 children.

The principal researcher then attended a meeting with the relevant school staff member. Following approval from the school principals, whole schools were randomly allocated to either the ER or BA programs, or the UCC condition. The schools themselves selected the classes for participation. Information sheets and consent forms were sent home with students of those classes to obtain consent from parents/caregivers. Participation required a signed consent from parents/guardians and students (i.e., optin), before the commencement of the first wave of data collection. Parents/guardians were also asked to provide their postal address so that followup questionnaires could be sent to their child in the event that they moved schools during the study.

A list of these schools was obtained from the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science based on the average household income in the postal code area where the adolescent lived. Schools received a written invitation to join the study. The principals were asked to allow the teachers of the experimental group to complete the training in the OVK program and implement the OVK lessons within the curriculum. After two weeks, the schools were contacted by telephone. If they agreed to participate, a member of the research team visited them and selected classes. The parents received a letter about the content and the aim of the program, describing the study procedures. Parents were asked to provide permission for their childs participation through passive consent. The data were not collected from adolescents whose parents did not give permission. Yet, their attendance in the program was obligatory, since it was included in the regular school curriculum. \" Eligibility Criteria Not reported Research Design Randomized trial Assignment Level Cluster Cluster Type Classroom Average Cluster Size Not reported Trial Arms 2 Sample Size 1,343 students, 61 classrooms, 12 schools Grade/School Level 7, 8 / Secondary School Age 13.42 (0.77) Percent Female 52% Percent Racce/Ethnicity Not reported Percent ELL Not reported Percent FRPL Not reported Country (State) Netherlands Geographic Area Not reported School Type Not reported Active Intervention OVK Comparison Group TAU Outcomes Depression diagnosis, Depression symptoms Risk of Bias Some Concerns Flow Diagram Yes Registration Dutch Trial Register NTR3110 Data/Code Availability Not reported References Kindt, K.

Study Kowalenko 2005 Title Short-term Effectiveness of a School-based Early Intervention Program for Adolescent Depression Start Date 1999 End Date Not reported Recruitment Approach All government high schools in the Northern Sydney area were contacted by the Department of Education and Training, inviting them to indicate interest in involvement in the ACE project. This consultation process, which also involved presentations at regional principals and school counsellors meetings, resulted in the selection of 11 schools. The schools consisted of two private single-sex schools (one male, one female), one selective boys school, one non-selective girls school, and seven co-educational public schools. At this point, the school principals and staff were individually consulted over all aspects of the implementation of the ACE program in their schools. Issues included: timing of the sessions; removing students from classes; interaction with other timetabling demands; release time for group leaders (school counsellors); costs; and communication with, and seeking permission from parents. Consultation also took place with the five local child and adolescent mental health teams in Northern Sydney Health, concerning the provision of adolescent counsellors as group leaders. The involvement of local community mental health services in the implementation of ACE helped to establish an ongoing working relationship between schools and local health workers. The project was introduced to students at the 11 schools through a series of year 9 assemblies, attended by school counsellors and community mental health service counsellors. Year 9 students were given an overview of the evaluation project, and invited to participate in the screening procedure. Students were informed that they were taking part in a survey to gain information about their age groups ways of thinking about, and coping with, problems and emotions. They were also informed that certain students would be selected to participate in trialling a new group program looking at ways to deal with typical adolescent problems. At all stages, the problem-solving, strategy-building focus of the program was emphasized. Active consent was sought from parents by all but one school (a non-government school). High school students (mean age 14.5 years) were screened for elevated depressive symptomatology using the CDI (Kovacs, 1992). Participants who scored above the epidemiologically based cut-off of 18 (Kovacs, 1992) on the CDI were invited to participate in the study. Participants were assessed for depressive symptomatology, coping skills and automatic thoughts. Grade 9 students and their parents at 11 high schools were asked to consent to screening using the CDI (Kovacs, 1992). Eight hundred and eighty-two students (55% of eligible students) returned consent forms and completed the CDI. As no data could be collected from students and parents who declined, it is not possible to ascertain differences between participants and non-participants. One hundred and seventy-nine students who scored above the CDI cut-off (of 18) (20% of screened students; 66 boys; 113 girls), were identified as at highrisk for depression. School counsellors interviewed the high-risk students and consent to participate in the study was obtained from 143 (80%; mean age 14 years, 7 months; 50 boys; 93 girls) of these students and their parents. Reasons for declining consent included parents not wanting students to miss regular classes, students leaving the school, and students not feeling comfortable about being in a small group with peers. Of those identified as being at-risk and invited to attend the ACE program, 82% of females and 76% of males agreed to participate.

Research personnel may also meet with principals and/or teachers in person to provide information about the study and answer any questions. Once principals formally agree to their schools participating in the trial, parents and students will be informed about the trial. All adolescents enrolled in their final year of secondary school in participating schools were invited to participate in the trial. All students at participating partially selective schools were eligible to participate in the trial; however, streaming status (ie, selective or comprehensive) was recorded and evaluated in analyses. Written, informed consent was sought from students and their parents prior to the start of the trial. Students who did not provide consent were able to access the assigned intervention; however, only those with consent completed the research questionnaires. A total of 23 secondary schools were approached between August 1 and November 28, 2014, to participate in the trial. Of 14 schools who initially agreed to participate, 4 dropped out prior to randomization leaving 10 schools contributing 7 to 126 participants each. A total of 540 students provided personal consent and obtained parental consent to participate. Eligibility Criteria All adolescents enrolled in their final year of high school in participating schools will be invited to participate. Due to the universal nature of the study, there were no exclusion criteria.

To ensure that there were enough participants with a high risk of depressive symptoms, we oversampled on risk status, which was established in two successive assessments in sixth and seventh grades. Adolescents were thought to be at high risk if they reported depressive mood (i.e., in the lower third of the distribution in the fall of both sixth and seventh grades, based on prior research evidence in another longitudinal study) (Ebata, 1987).

Study Pophillat 2016 Title Preventing Internalizing Problems in 68 Year Old Children: A Universal School-Based Program Start Date Not reported End Date Not reported Recruitment Approach All Year 1-3 classes from a low SES primary school were targeted, providing a sample of 217 students and their parents. Active consent was sought from all parents, followed by a passive consent. A 2-stage consent process was employed, whereby active consent was sought from all parents of Years 13 children, followed by a passive consent procedure. Ninety-five percent of parents actively or passively consented to their child's participation. Informed consent was obtained from both next of kin and the children in written form. The child consent form contains information that the child can understand and has their signature of consent on it and the case is the same for the parents. Students were provided with brief information about the project, and verbal assent to participate was sought. The parents of 11 children actively refused, leaving 206 students and their parents.

(2014). Post-hoc power analyses using G*Power 3.1.7 (Buchner, Erdfelder, Faul, &amp; Lang, 2013) showed that a power of 0.97 was achieved for small effect sizes (partial h2 ¬º 0.01; correlation among repeated measures ¬º 0.67;  ¬º 0.53; number of measurements ¬º 13) when including the 159 participants who completed all assessments. Seven secondary schools in selected cities and towns in The Netherlands agreed to participate in the study. Adolescent girls in the first two years of these schools (grade 7 and 8) and their parents received information regarding the study and could withdraw from the study before screening. Additionally, participants and parents gave active written consent for study participation past the initial screening. In total, 962 girls were screened (T0) during November and December 2012, at school during class-time, using the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS-2; Reynolds, 2002). To be eligible for further participation in the study, girls had to score at or above the 70th percentile on depressive symptoms within the sample (RADS-2 score  59, n ¬º 297). Exclusion criteria were suicidal ideation (score 2 on Childrens Depression Inventory item 9, n ¬º 2) and currently receiving mental health care (n ¬º 26). Girls indicating suicidal ideation at screening, or any time point within the study, were contacted along with their parents and were provided information on possible mental health care services they could access. Girls were informed of this procedure at the start of the study. Suicidal ideation (n ¬º 6) during intervention or at followup was not an exclusion criteria. The 269 girls meeting inclusion criteria were contacted to participate in the study, of which 46 declined to participate and fifteen could not be contacted (see Fig. 1). In the end, 208 girls were enrolled in the study.\" Eligibility Criteria \"To be eligible for further participation in the study, girls had to score at or above the 70th percentile on depressive symptoms within the sample (RADS-2 score  59, n ¬º 297).

The principals of two schools refused participation, expressing concerns for the potential loss of lessons for their normal school curriculum. A written description of the study was sent to the parents of the eighth graders at the four participating schools. Additionally, we described the study in detail to the adolescents and their parents in a parentteacher conference. In these conferences the adolescents, parents, and their class teachers discussed the participation of the class and decided together if the class as a whole should participate in the study. As result of this procedure, all classes invited to participate in the study decided to give consent. Furthermore, all parents and adolescents not participating in the parentteacher conferences gave their consent. Adolescents, parents, and teachers of the intervention and control groups were informed about the programs objectives to strengthen the skills of the adolescents and to facilitate their coping with strains. It was explained that having a control group is essential in order to study the programs effects.

Depending on school district requirements, passive or active informed consent was used for approval to collect data on student participants. A recruitment flyer along with the consent form was given to each student to take home. For passive consent, caregivers of student participants were given a week to opt their student out of the study. After caregiver consent was established, students were asked to participate in the study and sign a consent form (if 18 years or older) or assent form (if under the age of 18). Students were told they would receive a $10.00 gift card to a local store (e.g., Target, Walmart, Dollar Tree, Amazon) for completing both pre- and posttest measures.\" Eligibility Criteria \"\"Two criteria were used to select student participants: (a) students must receive special education services including students currently on an Individualized Education Plan or on a 504 plan, and (b) students must be transition age (ages 14-21). Because students with disabilities are identified as vulnerable to mental health problems they are considered a selected prevention population. No mental health diagnostic screening criteria were used as inclusion or exclusion criteria. In addition, data were not used on students whose disability impacted their ability to comprehend the curriculum and measures (this was determined by the students teacher).\" \"Teachers that were recruited for the study were allowed to participate in the study if they were the instructor of a self-contained classroom for transition age students with disabilities.

For the current pilot, for objective 1, a total of 300 students across three schools were screened using CDI and CES-DC and a socio-demographic data sheet which contained items on inclusion and exclusion criteria as well. The three schools were selected randomly from a pool of schools that gave permission to carry out the study. For the current study, students of Grade 9 who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria constituted the intervention (n = 13) and the control (n = 6) groups. Informed consent was obtained from principals and parents and assent from students prior to recruitment. For the intervention condition, one section (n = 40) of Grade 9 of a school was screened. 15 girls met inclusion criteria, of which 2 had to be excluded on account of absence due to girls scout camp. For the control condition, one section (n = 36) of Grade 9 of another branch of the intervention school was screened. 7 met inclusion criteria; 1 student declined to participate without giving any reason. 6 girls were selected in the final sample, all of whom attended the psycho-educatory session Eligibility Criteria At-risk for depression was operationalized as having elevated but subclinical symptoms of depression, defined by cut-off scores on Childrens Depression Inventory (CDI) and Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC).

Four hundred and nineteen Year 10 students (average age 14 years) identifying as Ma - ori and Pacific in eight secondary schools in the North Island of New Zealand were screened for depressive symptoms with the Childrens Depression Inventory (Kovacs, 1992) using a passive consent process. Passive consent meant in this case that parents or caregivers and students were advised about the screening but that no signed consents were necessary from either for the student to take part. The process involved informing the young people of the screening through an assembly and form room talks, and the parents through newsletter articles and letters given to students to take home. Parents or caregivers were given the opportunity to contact the school, the researcher or the supervising university with any questions or concerns, and both caregivers/parents and students were informed of the students right to not participate at any point in the study. This method of consent was chosen because there were seen to be logistical problems with administering the questionnaires in schools where some parents had given consent and others had not, and screening of a whole cohort meant that young people who might otherwise be missed and who might be at risk of depression were identified. Schools were selected from across the socioeconomic range using Ministry of Education decile rankings (Ministry of Education, 1997). Two of the schools were drawn from the Wellington metropolitan area, which statistically is a better-educated and higher-income area than the average sector of New Zealand (Statistics New Zealand, 2003). Five schools were located in the greater metropolitan area, which is diverse in terms of income and ethnicity and one school was from a provincial city, replacing a metropolitan school that had to withdraw immediately prior to the screening process because of ill health of the school counsellor. All eight schools approached agreed to take part in the study. The schools consisted of five state coeducational schools, one state single-sex girls school, one integrated single-sex girls school and one integrated single-sex boys school. All Year 10 (average age 14 years) Maori and Pacific students were screened, with all stakeholders being made aware of the aims and time frames of all aspects of the program and its implementation.

First, letters and consent forms were sent home to families describing the depression screening. On the day of the screening, youth whose parents consented to the screening were informed of the procedures, and those who wanted to participate signed a screening assent form. From a total of 9123 students, 2923 (32.0 %) returned parental consent forms, provided assent, and completed the depression screening. Screening rates ranged from 14.1 to 57.1%across the 10 schools. The screening consisted of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies- Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloff 1977), a 20-item measure that assesses depressive symptoms over the past week. Adolescents with a CES-D score of 16 or higher were eligible to be approached for the prevention project. As in our prior studies, we used the adult criterion of a score equal to or greater than 16 because we wanted to identify as many adolescents as possible with elevated depressive symptoms. The average CES-D score of the 2923 youth screened was 10.00 (SD=9.51); 593 youth had an elevated CES-D score and were eligible to be approached about the prevention study. These adolescents and their parents were contacted by research staff to describe the prevention project.\" Eligibility Criteria \"Adolescents with a CES-D score of 16 or higher were eligible to be approached for the prevention project.\" Research Design Randomized trial Assignment Level Individual Cluster Type NA Average Cluster Size NA Trial Arms 2 Sample Size 186 students, 10 schools Grade/School Level 7, 8, 9, 10 / Middle School and High School Age 14.01 (1.22) Percent Female 66.7% Percent Racce/Ethnicity 8.1% Asian, 19.9% Black, 38.2% Latinx, 38.4% White Percent ELL Not reported Percent FRPL Not reported Country (State) United States (New Jersey) Geographic Area Not reported School Type Not reported Active Intervention Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training Comparison Group TAU Outcomes Depression symptoms Risk of Bias Some Concerns Flow Diagram Yes Registration Not reported Data/Code Availability Not reported References Young, J.
